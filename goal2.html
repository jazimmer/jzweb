<H2>Neither hurt others nor be overly touchy</H2>

   This goal is a bit reminiscent of the well-known Golden Rule, 
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".  
<P>
   All six goals, however, differ from the Golden Rule in an 
important way: taken together they ask you pay attention to what 
other people actually want.  Is somebody reacting with hurt in a 
situation where you would not?  You ought to be sensitive to that.
<P>
   Of course, it is possible to react with hurt without
anybody doing anything hurtful.This goal gives nobody an
excuse to be touchy.
