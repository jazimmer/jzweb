<b><i>What I have difficulty understanding is why history
keeps repeating itself in spite of literature which clearly
explains the difficulties.</i></b>

The aoul [village] which had been destroyed was that in
which Hadji Murad had spent the night before
he went over to the Russians. Sado and his family
had left the aoul on the approach of the Russian de-
tachment, and when he returned he found his saklya in
ruins—the roof fallen in, the door and the posts sup-
porting the penthouse burned, and the interior filthy.
His son, the handsome bright-eyed boy who had gazed
with such ecstasy at Hadji Murad, was brought dead
to the mosque on a horse covered with a barka; he had
been stabbed in the back with a bayonet. the dignified
woman who had served Hadji Murad when he was at
the house now stood over her son’s body, her smock
torn in front, her withered old breasts exposed, her hair
down, and she dug her hails into her face till it bled,
and wailed incessantly. Sado, taking a pick-axe and
spade, had gone with his relatives to dig a grave for his
son. The old grandfather sat by the wall of the ruined
saklya cutting a stick and gazing stolidly in front of
him. He had only just returned from the apiary. The
two stacks of hay there had been burnt, the apricot and
cherry trees he had planted and reared were broken
and scorched, and worse still all the beehives and bees
had been burnt. The wailing of the women and the little
children, who cried with their mothers, mingled with
the lowing of the hungry cattle for whom there was no
food. The bigger children, instead of playing, followed
their elders with frightened eyes. The fountain was polluted, 
evidently on purpose, so that the water could not
be used. The mosque was polluted in the same way, and
the Mullah and his assistants were cleaning it out. No
one spoke of hatred of the Russians. the feeling experienced by all the Chechens, from the youngest to the
oldest, was stronger than hate. It was not hatred, for
they did not regard those Russian dogs as human beings, but it was such repulsion, disgust, and perplexity
at the senseless cruelty of these creatures, that the desire to exterminate them—like the desire to exterminate
rats, poisonous spiders, or wolves—was as natural an
instinct as that of self-preservation.

This is the beginning of the 17th chapter.  The previous
chapter described a Russian soldier who left the destruction
of that village very satisfied with himself.  And that for
reasons that had nothing to do with the village.

We say we are "nation building" but the "building" works for
only a small segment of the population.   For the others our behavior breeds enemies.
This is pretty well documented in Anand Gopal's New Yorker
article,
