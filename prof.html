<H3> Function Fluency </H3>
<DL><DD>
  I believe that one reason students have difficulty with mathematics is
a lack of fluency with the language of functions.  Students see the word
"function" often enough in math classes but they aren't ask to use it in
meaningful ways.
  <A HREF='http://functionfluency.com'>Function Fluency</A> is a set
  of online exercises being developed correct this deficiency.

<H3> Python </H3>
<DL><DD>
   Influenced in the 1960's by the APL programming language, I have
always liked an interactive environment for trying new things&mdash;in 
particular an interactive environment that lets me save variables and
what not for use again the next time I sit down to work.
<P>Python provides an almost perfect interactive environment, just not
the ability to save my work.  For that I have created a 
<a href="source_code/python/workspace/index.html">workspace module</A>
that you may wish to play with.</P>

<P>I have used a version of this workspace twice in a summer institute
for middle school teachers.  Many of those attending were able to work
through 
<a href="source_code/python/workspace/lab2007.html">this lab</a> with
additional help from me.  You may wish to try it as it provides a
rather gentle introduction to Python.</P>

<P>A few others share my belief that Python is an excellent tool for
developing mathematical maturity in high school students.  
<a href="http://www.skylit.com/mathandpython.html">Here</A> is one
of the first textbooks written in support of that belief.</P>

<H3>Tcl/Tk</H3></P>

<DL><DD>
Almost 14 years ago, the IEEE Computer Society published my book, 
<Q>Tcl/Tk for Programmers</Q>.  
The current version of
Tcl is little changed from the one I covered in that book and the book is
still in print (although it has changed publishers to John Wiley and Sons).
For your perusal, about a fifth of the material has always been 
<A HREF="tclbook/home.html">online</A>.
<P>
After nine years in the same form, one might call
<Q>Tcl/Tk for Programmers</Q>
a classic.  I won't because it has
not sold very many copies in any one year.  The thing is it just keeps
on selling at the same rate.

<H3> Java  </H3>
<P><DL><DD> 

I have created a <A
HREF="source_code/java/zio.html"> package of
classes</A> for GUI application programming with image and text file
I/O. I tried for something useful for teaching but flexible and robust
enough for my own programming needs.
