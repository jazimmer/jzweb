<CENTER><H1>Six Daily Goals</H1>
</CENTER>
I suppose we all set goals for ourselves from time to time.  Goals
that we'd like to live up to because we think they will help us take
full advantage of our lives.  These six daily goals are the most
serious effort I have made in that direction.  The effort of creating
these goals has forced me to think, as best I can, about the
universal human condition.  The effort has been good for me.  Now it
is your turn to give these ideas a little thought.

<P>

I have placed all six goals and the accompanying discussions in the
public domain.  You may copy them.  In fact, I wish you would.  My
one request is that you include a reference to this web page with 
each copy.

More than a decade after writing these, I was moved to
write <A HREF='5Truths.html'>Five Truths</A> about life.
