Early in this film elderly caregiver Jang Mi-ja learns that
she is coming down with Alzheimer's disease.  Given the
other obstacles she faces, namely

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="210px" src="file:/Volumes/JZDATA/__Current/__WatchAndTalk/Poetry/images/Poetry/Writing.png" alt="image: Writing poetry"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

you might expect emotional fireworks.  But Jang Mi-jan's is a
gentle person who doesn't let herself be pushed around.  The
way she is pushed and the way she resists are Korean.  You
will leave this movie having met someone you can admire who
probably doesn't think the way you do.

<div  class="relative paragraph indent">&nbsp;</div> There is a place in the film where the
possibility of paying reparation for something the grandson
has done is discussed.  In Korea paying reparation is sometimes a way of
avoiding criminal consequences.  This  seems a bit like blood
money to me.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> But when I stop to think about it I realize that the
U.S. also has a way of paying reparations in lieu of criminal
consequences.  This happens when guilty verdicts are not
possible.  In such cases the civil courts may be used to pay
reparation to victims.  A famous example of this happened with
the O.J. Simpson case.  First there was a criminal trial which
acquitted Simpson of the charge of murdering his ex-wife and a
friend.  Then the friend's father sued Simpson in civil court
and won a monetary judgement.  

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> So criminal consequences and reparation payments are mixed
up in both the U.S. and Korean legal systems.  I suspect some
kind of mixture is normal in most societies.  This film
however shows a surprising twist, something only Jang Mi-jan
seems to have thought through.


<div  class="relative paragraph indent">&nbsp;</div>

Jang Mi-jan silently keeps her own moral compass.  Only at the
end of the story does she express herself.  She does so with a
poem.  Her nascent Alzheimer's probably influences her choices
but it doesn't slow her down or ruin her writing skill.
