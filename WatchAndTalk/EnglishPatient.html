</div><h1>“ English Patient”</h1><div class="relative paragraph">
</div><h2>A Film Review</h2><div class="relative paragraph">

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="325px" src="images/2ViewsOfLazlo.png" alt="image: Lazlo, Before and After"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

Anthony Minghella's 1996 film “ English Patient” tells us
about the life of a Hungarian aristocrat, Lazlo Almàsy, in the
period around WWII.  The film cuts between two segments of
Almàsy's life: one in North Africa, where he is a healthy
multilingual cartographer, and the other segment in Italy,
where he is badly burned and anonymously known as “The English
Patient”. 

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> The photography and film editing are superb. North Africa
is sunny and magnificent.  Italy is blue-tinged and instantly
recognizable as not-Africa.  Transitions between the two
segments are both creative and nonobtrusive.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> Although the movie begins in Africa, the African segment is
a flashback. As the movie progresses the various flashbacks
become more than just flashbacks.  They become part of the English
Patient's defense against charges that he is responsible for
the death and suffering of lots of people.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> His defense is both convincing and ambiguous.  If you do
something that indirectly and unintentionally causes death,
what is your degree of responsibility?  What if your action
merely causes different people to die?

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> There are five important relationships in this movie.  

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="275px" src="images/Cartographers.png" alt="image: International Sand Club"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> The first consists of a group of cartographers operating
out of Cairo, Egypt.  This a multinational group of friends.
Their ethnic diversity is emphasized in a scene in which they
amuse themselves by singing a verse of "Yes, We Have No
Bananas" in various languages.

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="275px" src="images/Cliftons.png" alt="image: Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

 The second relationship consists of a married couple, the
Cliftons, who have known each other since childhood. Geoffrey
Clifton's pain at his wife's infidelity causes a major event
in the movie's plot.

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="275px" src="images/AlmasyKatherine.png" alt="image: Almasy and Katherine"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> The third is a romantic relationship between Almàsy and Katherine
Clifton.  This is the primary love story of the film.  

</div><div class="relative paragraph">
At one point Katherine
says "In Egypt I am a different wife."  This is significant
both within the film and as an explanation for infidelity.

<div  class="relative paragraph indent">

Within the film,  Almàsy fantasizes that Katherine is actually
his wife.  He draws upon this fantasy when he
convinces a British officer in Italy that he is English.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> In the October 2017 Atlantic magazine, family therapist
Esther Perel writes that infidelity is often caused, not by
bad marriages, but because marriage does not bring out all
aspects of a personality.  Relationships outside a marriage allow
one to be a different person.

</div>

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="275px" src="images/AlmasyHana.png" alt="image: Almasy and Hana"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

The fourth relationship is between Almàsy and Hana,
a nurse who takes care of him in Italy.  This is a platonic
romance. 

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="275px" src="images/HanaKip.png" alt="image: Hana and Kip"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

The fifth relationship is a romance between
Hana and Kip.   Kip is a Sikh whose job is to find and defuse
explosives.  He finds one in a piano Hana is starting to play.

</div><div class="relative paragraph">
Taken together these relationships give us three messages:

<ul><li>
romantic love is not exclusive, 
</li><li> personal relationships are much more
important than cultural or national differences, and 
</li><li> actions have consequences.
</li></ul>

Other relationships in the film reinforce these same
messages:  Arab nomads save Almàsy's life for no other
reason`
than that he is a fellow human in need.  Kip is very close to
his coworker sargent although the sargent is from a very
different cultural background.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> “The English Patient” is an adaptation from a book of the
same name by Michael Ondaatje.  Ondaatje was born in what was
then Ceylon but lives in Canada and writes in English.  He
adds a jab at Anglo-Saxon racism to the ending of his book.
In discussing the bombing of Hiroshima a character says:
“they would never have dropped such a bomb on a white
nation.”  Menghalla, a Brit, includes no mention of Hiroshima
in his movie.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> Ondaatje's story is very loosely based on the WWII
activities of an actual Hungarian aristocrat, also named
Almàsy.  As in the movie the real Almàsy was a member of an
international group of cartographers operating out of Cairo
and was known to have acted in a way that was not
beneficial to the Allied forces.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> Both the book and the movie have won major awards and not
just for the ways they put this story together. The beauty of
the book's prose and the beauty of the film's visuals played
no small role in the judges' appreciation.  

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> To summarize: “The English Patient” is well-made film
which delivers the above three messages in an easily
digestible and visually appealing form.
