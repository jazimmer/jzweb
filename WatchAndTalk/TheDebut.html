<div class="caption">“Het Debuut” aka “The Debut”, 1977, Nouchka van Brakel</div>

“The Debut” is yet another film in which a teenage girl has an affair
with a much older man.  The IMDB movie database lists over 100
such films under the title “Films of Young Women Coming of
Age”. This one however is told in a nuanced way and from the
girl's point of view.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> We see Carolien on a bicycle during both the
beginning and ending credits.

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="225px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/WatchAndTalk/images/TheDebut/Credits.png" alt="image: Beginning and Ending Credits"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">
At the end she appears much more lady like.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> Nouchka Van Brakel directed and co-wrote “The Debut”
having taken the story from a novel of the same name.  Both the
novelist and the director are  Dutch women.  Culture and
gender enabled them to show Carolien's enthusiasm for an affair
she both initiates and ends while at the same time including
the inevitable complications.

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="250px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/WatchAndTalk/images/TheDebut/Hooray.png" alt="image: Hooray I lost my virginity"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

In this scene Caroline runs out onto a hotel balcony to share
with the world her joy at having lost her virginity&mdash;a childish reaction to a more grown-up experience.

</div><div class="relative paragraph">
It is Carolien who first lays hands on Hugo, not the other way
around.  We have a hint that this is the way it will be in
an allegorical scene.

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="250px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/WatchAndTalk/images/TheDebut/Kites.png" alt="image: Chasing kites"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

Two kites fly past Carolien and she tries to catch them.
She almost does but they fly free and attempt to ensnare Hugo as
they leave.  Although we don't know it yet, Caroline is about to ensnare Hugo into
something that won't work.

</div><div class="relative paragraph">
It is of course her youth and looks that let Carolien seduce
Hugo.  In the first steps he follows willingly into her more
childish world.

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="250px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/WatchAndTalk/images/TheDebut/Silliness2.png" alt="image: Mocking a realtor"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

Here they are mocking a realtor who has been praising how very
comfortable every chair in a furnished apartment is.

</div><div class="relative paragraph">
But Hugo is 41, symbolically the opposite of Carolien's 14.
He is completely out of place at a teenage party she brings
him to&mdash;just as out of place as she is in a fancy restaurant
he brings her to.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> Van Brakel's film is well made and there are several
artful nuances.  Another example is the way in which we learn that
Carolien takes control of sex.  The point is made without any
hint of pornography.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> In spite of the film's quality “The Debut”
has a poor rating of 5.8 at IMDB.  At first I thought this was
because of the taboo we place on such relationships.  But
there are other films that break the same taboo and get better
ratings.  I suspect that the problem with “The Debut” is that it
involves ordinary people.  Hugo is no predator.  Carolien is no
nymphomanic.  These ordinary people get away with breaking a
taboo.

</div><div class="relative paragraph"> Not that they get away scot-free.  Hugo faces a hotel
staff who believe sexploitation is going on.  Carolien must
deal as best she can with a classmate who thinks that her
relationship with Hugo means she is freely available to
anybody who wants her.

</div><div class="relative paragraph">
At the end of the film, Caroline's mother puts together the
clues she has been given and recognizes what has happened.
Her first reaction is anger.

</div><div class="paragraph center"><img class="displayed" height="250px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/WatchAndTalk/images/TheDebut/ItsOver.png" alt="image: Sympathy"/></div><div class="relative paragraph">

But her anger very quickly gives way to empathy for what her
daughter is going through.  What might that be?  Is Caroline
merely feeling the pangs of an impossible relationship that
seemed so wonderful at the beginning?  Or is she forever
scarred by her experience?  This film, which is 
rigidly honest as far as it goes, gives no hint of the latter.  As for those of
us in the audience, I suppose we will project our own biases
into the answer.
