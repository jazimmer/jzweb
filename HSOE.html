 <h1> Advanced Abstraction</h1>
 <div class='content'>
<p>
    If you are rather good at math and want to get much better, then what you study isn't as important as how you study it.  You need to be pushed to think in the language of math, to think abstractly. 
</p><p>
    Learning a language requires practice.  The best form of math practice is immersion in a graduate degree program.  Short of that one of the better ways is to practice programming in a computer language that is itself a dialect of math. This is because the computer forces you to speak correctly.
</p><p>
   Haskell is such a language.  And 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Haskell-School-Expression-Functional-Programming/dp/0521644089/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1442343426&sr=1-1&keywords=haskell+school+of+expression">The Haskell School of Expression</a> is a book   that will truly stretch your mind&mdash;probably too far unless you already have a math degree or are lucky enough to have a good tutor.
</p><p>
   I have worked through much of this book with four different students.  It covers graphics programming.  The work starts out simple and quickly becomes quite abstract.  Functional languages such as Haskell are not efficient for computer graphics.  Students will learn many of the concepts of graphics programming but not in any practical way.  The main point of doing this is merely to increase your mathematical maturity.
</p><p>
   It has been some time since I worked with this material and the necessary software has changed a bit since then.  Prep time for me will be rather large.   You should also know I fear it is not unlikely a student will quit after a couple lessons.  For those reasons I require payment of $1000 up front.  This covers a signup fee and 15 lessons.  There is no refund.  Additional lessons are possible (and probably necessary) at my normal fee.  There is no discount for multiple students.
</p><p>
By the way, no student has yet dropped out of studying this material with me.  However, the reason for that would be that all four previous students and I knew each other well before they started.
