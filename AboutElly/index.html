Characters</h1><p> Kenneth Turan, writing in the LA Times, has
an interesting <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-about-elly-review-20150508-column.html">review</a>.</p><p>And
<a
href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/about-elly-2015">here</a>
is another review from Roger Ebert.</p><p>"About Elly" is a
bit hard to follow because so many characters play a
significant role. 
The movie throws you into the middle of a bunch of
friends just as Elly is.  Only it is harder for us because the
Iranian names are so unfamiliar. 
If there is a principle protagonist, it
isn't Elly but rather Sepideh who has invited Elly on a trip
to the Caspian sea with the intention of bringing Elly and
Sepideh's friend Ahmad together.  (Elly only appears a few
times in the movie.)</p><p><figure><img width="300px"

all there are three married couples. Peyman and Shohreh are
perhaps the second most important couple in the movie.  One of
their children will be in danger of drowning.</p><p>

characters are enough to think about before the movie starts.
Try to remember their names:  Amir and Sepideh, Peyman and
Shohreh, and the divorced Ahmad.  Of course, there is also
Elly whom you won't see much of.  </p><p>You get a real taste
of social lying and group decision making, Iranian style, in this movie.</p></body></html>
