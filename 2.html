<p>I spend part of my time teaching creative problem solving in mathematics and
computer science to online students.  
Using collaborative tools from Google, I offer individualized instruction.
</p><p>
Mathematics and computer programming are good subjects for teaching 
problem solving because they force a student to be creative within precise
constraints.  Creativity involves putting ideas together in new ways.
Small children can do that. The trick is to make the pieces fit together
harmoniously.
This is a difficult trick to learn.    Everybody deserves
a class that helps with the learning.  (<a href='3.html'>Why</a>?)
</p><p>
I have decades of experience helping students learn to create correct
answers to problems in college-level mathematics and computer science.  
I do this
by focusing on individual needs and de-emphasizing any particular
curriculum.  Before doing this online, I did it for high school students as well as
for practicing programmers in a M.Sc. program.
</p>
<p>
My online courses last fourteen weeks and
consist of two 55 minute contacts per week.  Students are expected to make
a substantial effort on their own but I am available by email when an
extra hint is needed.
