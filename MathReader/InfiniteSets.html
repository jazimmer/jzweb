<h1 class="spaced1">Sizing Sets</h1>

Are these two sets the same size?  

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/sameSizeQuestion.png" alt="image: The Same Size?"/></div>

One way to answer is to say “No, because the one on
the left has three elements and the one on the right has
four.”

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Counting is an effective way to compare
the sizes of some sets,
but when you try to count some other sets, the counting never ends.
We call those sets <span class="italicjz">infinite</span>.  <span class="italicjz">Finite</span> sets of course
are those that can be counted in finite
time.  To know a set is finite we must be able to
show that 
counting will come to an end&mdash;although perhaps not in our
lifetimes.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> In this chapter we will look at a
way to do endless counting.  Later on we will consider the
possibility that even endless counting is not enough to size
some sets.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Of course
we need examples of infinite sets to work with.  Our number
system provides plenty of examples.

<h2 class="first">Numbers Again</h2>

The real numbers <span class="boldjz code">R</span> and two of its subsets, <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> (the
integers) and <span class="boldjz code">N</span> (the natural numbers), are good subjects
talking about things infinite because we have a common
understanding about their properties.  When talking about
recursive functions
we worked with intervals of real numbers.  Here we will work
with intervals of integers as well.  To
distinguish between different kinds of intervals we will use the following
notation.

<ul><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">[x,y]</sup></span>
represents all the numbers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> including both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> 
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are numbers with
<span class="code">x≤y</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[x,y]</sup></span>
represents all the integers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> including both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> 
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are integers with
<span class="code">x≤y</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(x,y)</sup></span> represents all the numbers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> excluding both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are numbers with
<span class="code">n&lt;m</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">(x,y)</sup></span> represents all the integers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> excluding both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are integers with
<span class="code">x&lt;y</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(x,∞)</sup></span>
represents the set of all numbers greater than <span class="code">x</span> (<span class="code">x</span>
is any number)  
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">(x,∞)</sup></span> 
represents the set of all integers greater than <span class="code">x</span> (<span class="code">x</span>
is any integer)  
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,y)</sup></span> 
represents the set of all numbers less than <span class="code">y</span>
(<span class="code">y</span> is any number). 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,y)</sup></span> 
represents the set of all integers less than <span class="code">y</span> (<span class="code">y</span> is
any integer).
</li></ul>

This notation makes it seem like ∞ is a number but it is
just a symbol we call “infinity”.  With
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(x,∞)</sup></span> ∞ means that
no finite number we might put in its place will be big enough
to describe the entire interval. With
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,y)</sup></span> ∞ means that no finite number we
might put in its place will be small enough to describe the
entire interval.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Extrapolating a bit from this notation can you find simple
ways of representing these intervals <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[1,∞)</sup></span> and
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,∞)</sup></span><span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[1,∞)</sup></span><span class="code">=<span class="boldjz">N</span></span> and
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,∞)</sup></span><span class="code">=<span class="boldjz">R</span></span>.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
When we are done with infinite sets we will understand how
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="sub_sup_size">(0,1)</sup></span> is bigger than <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> and the same size as
<span class="boldjz code">R</span>.

<h2 class="next">Counting</h2>

Imagine you are counting apples in a basket.  One way to do it
is to put labels, <span class="code">1,2,3,…,n</span>, on them.  When the last
label is <span class="code">n</span>, that is the size of the set of apples in
that basket.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> This being a book about mathematics, our labels will be
elements of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and we will link those labels in a
one-to-one way with the apples instead of putting labels on
them.  Of course the linking starts with the label 1, and
continues with 2, then 3, and so on. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Here is a representation of four links between
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[1,4]</sup></span> and a set.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/Count1.png" alt="image: Counting a set of size 4"/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Lines are a good way to show the links between the numeric
labels and the set's elements but sometimes they are
too imprecise.  For more precision we define a <span class="italicjz">link</span>
between a set <span class="code">A</span> and a set <span class="code">B</span> as a two-element set
with one element from <span class="code">A</span> and the other from <span class="code">B</span>. Each
of these elements is an <span class="italicjz">end</span> of the link.  A link between
<span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is the same as a link between <span class="code">B</span> and
<span class="code">A</span> because two element sets {<span class="code">x,y</span>} and {<span class="code">y,x</span>} are
the same set.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> For infinite sets, the counting process does not end.  In this diagram

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/Count3.png" alt="image: Counting an infinite set"/></div>

we see
two ways of linking elements of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> with real
numbers.  These represent two ways of counting real numbers.
Both would continue forever and neither would count all 
the real numbers.  

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display"> We need to think of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and
<span class="boldjz code">R</span> as two distinct sets to make this work.  Otherwise the
link between 1 in <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and 1 in <span class="boldjz code">R</span> would be a one
element set (not a two element set with one element in <span class="boldjz code">N</span>
and the other in <span class="boldjz code">R</span> as required).  However since all we
are doing is finding a way to count elements it is ok to think
of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and <span class="boldjz code">R</span> as different copies of themselves.  </div>

Do the above diagrams  indicate that
there are more real numbers than natural numbers<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
No.  Such linkings between <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and <span class="boldjz code">R</span> are mere 
failures at counting all the real numbers.
To show that there is no way of linking all the natural
numbers in <span class="boldjz code">N</span> with all the numbers in <span class="boldjz code">R</span> requires a clever argument.  Proving a
negative tends to be difficult.
</div>


<h2 class="next">Matchings</h2>  

Our basic tool for investigating the relative sizes of sets is
the matching.  Here are the relevant definitions:
<div  class="indent display">
 A set of links between a set <span class="code">A</span> and another set <span class="code">B</span>
is called a <span class="italicjz">relation</span>.  Since the link {<span class="code">a,b</span>} is the same as 
the link {<span class="code">b,a</span>}, relations are symmetric, i.e. a relation
between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is also a relation between <span class="code">B</span>
and <span class="code">A</span>.

<br/><br/>
A relation <span class="code">R</span>
<ul><li>
<span class="italicjz">covers</span> <span class="code">A</span>  in case every element of <span class="code">A</span> 
is included in some link of <span class="code">R</span>.
</li><li>
<span class="italicjz">separates</span> <span class="code">A</span>  in case every element of <span class="code">A</span>  
is included in no more than one link of <span class="code">R</span>.
</li></ul>

A relation 
is a <span class="italicjz">matching</span> in case it separates both
<span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>.

<br/><br/> A matching is <span class="italicjz">complete</span> in case it covers
both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>.
</div>

Here is an example of a set of links that is not even close to
being a matching

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="155px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/matching1.png" alt="image: Not a matching"/></div>

because neither <span class="code">A</span> or <span class="code">B</span> is separated or completely
covered.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Here is a property of matchings we will need in later
chapters.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
<span class="boldjz">P7.1</span> 
<div  class="indent display">
Any subset <span class="code">M'</span> of a matching <span class="code">M</span> between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>
is a matching between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>.
</div>
<span class="boldjz">Proof</span>
<div  class="indent display">
Since <span class="code">M'</span> is clearly a relation, all we need to know is that <span class="code">M'</span> separates both <span class="code">A</span> and
<span class="code">B</span>, i.e. no two links in <span class="code">M'</span> have an
end in common.  
They will not because, if they did, there
would be two links in <span class="code">M</span> that have an end in common.
</div><div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>

There is a subtlety here worth thinking about.
The empty set ∅ is a subset of <span class="code">M</span> and so P7.1
says it is a matching.  This is ok because the condition that
makes a relation a matching 
only talks about links in the
relation.  When there are no links, there is no condition to
satisfy.  The definition of a matching excludes relations with links 
that share an element.  All other relations are accepted.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="boldjz">P7.2</span>
<div  class="indent display">
A relation <span class="code">R</span> between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is a  matching exactly
when every element of <span class="code">A<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0.2em;vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋃</span>B</span> is in at most one link of
<span class="code">R</span>.
</div>
<span class="boldjz">Proof</span>
<div  class="indent display">
This result just applies the concept of separation to both
<span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>.
</div>

<span class="boldjz">P7.3</span>
<div  class="indent display">
A relation <span class="code">R</span> between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is a complete matching exactly when every element of <span class="code">A<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0.2em;vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋃</span>B</span> is in exactly one link of <span class="code">R</span>.
</div>

<span class="boldjz">Proof</span>
<div  class="indent display">
This result follows from P7.2 and the fact that a matching
<span class="code">R</span> is complete exactly when both <span class="code">A</span>
and <span class="code">B</span> are covered.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Let's return to thinking about the empty set because that can
be tricky.  Here is a question to
practice on: can you say what has to be true for
the empty set to be a complete matching<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div> <h4>answer</h4> <div  class="indent display"> Since ∅ is always a
matching, P7.3 tells us that all we need is for every element of <span class="code">A<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0.2em;vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋃</span>B</span>
to be in exactly one link.  So if either <span class="code">A</span> or <span class="code">B</span> has
any elements, the empty set, having no links at all, cannot be a complete matching
between them.  But if both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are empty then
the empty set is a complete matching because all the elements
found in <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are in exactly one link of ∅.
</div>

<h2 class="next">A Theory of Set Sizes</h2>

The theory of set sizes we learned in elementary school has us
counting the elements in a finite set until the counting
stops.  The last number counted is called the
<span class="italicjz">cardinality</span> of a set <span class="code">S</span> and it is denoted
<span class="code">|S|</span>. For finite sets, cardinality measures size. 

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
The <span class="code">|x|</span> notation has multiple meanings.  It means absolute value when <span class="code">x</span> is a
number and cardinality when <span class="code">x</span> is a set.
</div>


In this monograph the concept of a complete matching replaces the
concept of cardinality.  We don't count elements of sets
unless they are finite and even then we don't have to count
elements to apply the concept of a complete matching.  Instead 
of counting, we say two sets <span class="code">A</span>
and <span class="code">B</span> are <span class="italicjz">size-equal</span> in case there is a complete
matching between them.  

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display"> So when <span class="code">S</span> is finite, it can be counted,
has cardinality <span class="code">|S|</span>, and is
also
size-equal with <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[1,|S|]</sup></span>.
</div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> We say a set <span class="code">S</span> is <span class="italicjz">countable</span> in case <span class="code">S</span> is
has a complete matching with <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[1,|S|]</sup></span> or with <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.
We can think of a set as being countable in case it has a complete
matching with a subset of <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.  Countable sets can be
counted even if the counting never comes to an end.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Here are examples of countable sets

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="190px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/Count2.png" alt="image: http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/Count2.png"/></div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Sets for which no complete matching with a subset of the natural
numbers exists are said to be
<span class="italicjz">uncountable</span>.  We will prove that uncountable sets exist
later.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
We want matchings between <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and finite sets to involve
consecutive natural numbers starting with 1.  That is we want
a finite <span class="code">S</span> to have a complete matching with
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[1,|S|]</sup></span>, not with with a subset of
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">[1,n]</sup></span>
where <span class="code">n>|S|</span>.  For example we do not

want a matching that looks like this
 
<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/countable.png" alt="image: Countable versus can be counted"/></div>

Can you argue that a matching of the kind we don't want can be
reduced to a matching of the kind we want<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
This is not easy to answer with an appropriate amount of
detail, but it is worth thinking about before you see
my solution.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="boldjz">answer</span>
<div  class="indent display">
The matchings we don't want have essentially been counted by
skipping over some of the required numbers.  For example
{<span class="code">2,5,6,9</span>} may have been matched to some 
four element set.  Skipping over some of the required numbers
means that the complete matching between <span class="code">S</span> and a subset
of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> has a link 
{<span class="code">k,s</span>}  for which there is no
link {<span class="code">k-1,s'</span>} in the matching. Call such a <span class="code">k</span>
undesirable.   Sum all the undesirable <span class="code">k</span><span class="smalljz">s</span> together.
This sum will be zero exactly
when there are no undesirable <span class="code">k</span>.

<br/><br/>
Pick an undesirable <span class="code">k</span>, remove the link {<span class="code">k,s</span>} and
replace it with a link {<span class="code">k-1,s</span>}.  What you get is another
complete matching between <span class="code">S</span> and a subset of <span class="boldjz code">N</span>, but
the sum of all <span class="code">k</span><span class="smalljz">s</span> for this complete matching is one
less.
<br/><br/>
Repeat this process of replacing one link with another until
the sum of all <span class="code">k</span><span class="smalljz">s</span> is 0.  That means there are no
such <span class="code">k</span><span class="smalljz">s</span> and the complete matching is between <span class="code">S</span>
and <span class="boldjz code">Z<sub class="sub_sup_size">[1,|S|]</sub></span>.
</div>

<h2 class="next">Countable Sets</h2>

Before continuing with our general theory let's look at what
<span class="code">size-equal</span> tells us about the sizes of infinite sets.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
It is obvious that the set of negative integers
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,-1]</sup></span> is size-equal to itself.
But what happens if we add a
few elements?  The following diagram shows that we can add
elements to <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,-1]</sup></span> and still have a set
that is size equal to <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="sub_sup_size">(-∞,-1]</sup></span>. 

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="220px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/comparing2.png" alt="image: Adding a Few Integers"/></div>

This is rather weird and even more weird is that it is
possible to remove infinitely many integers from a countable set of
integers and the reduced set is still size-equal to the
original.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="190px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/comparing3.png" alt="image: Odd Positive Integers Are Countable"/></div>


<h2 class="next">Super Countable Sets?</h2>

It is not just possible to subtract countably many elements
from a countable set and still keep it countable  it is
possible to add countably many elements and still keep it
countable.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The technique of defining a complete matching by drawing links between two sets is not going to be very helpful here.  Lets look at another technique.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
This new technique can be explained with an example. The complete matching between <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and the odd
integers seen in the last section could have been established
this way

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="80px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/comparing7.png" alt="image: Positive Odd Integers are Countable"/></div>

Here the first arrow counts 1, the second 2, the third 3, and
so forth.  The relationship between these arrows and the
complete matching of the previous section can be shown this
way

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="180px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/comparing4.png" alt="image: How Arrows Count"/></div>

Counting with arrows is a way to show that a complete matching
with <span class="boldjz code">N</span> exists when that matching is too complex for
drawing the links.  Let's use arrows to show that
the set of all integers is countable.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="140px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/countableInts.png" alt="image: Z is countable"/></div>

Although
<span class="boldjz code">Z</span> seems to be a bit more than twice as large as
<span class="boldjz code">N</span>, this diagram shows <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> is size-equal with <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Can we include lots more additional numbers and still have a
set that is  size-equal to <span class="boldjz code">N</span>?  Let's look at the rational
numbers. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The rational numbers are those numbers which can be
expressed as a fraction with an integer in both the numerator
and the denominator.  
Are the rationals also countable? We can answer that in the
affirmative with arrows, but first
we need a way of representing all of the
rationals in
a diagram.  This will do the trick.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="215px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/rationals1.png" alt="image: Charting the Rationals"/></div>

This pattern includes all the rationals and more.
In fact each fraction appears infinitely many times.
For example, 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1/1, 2/2, 3/3, …
</div>

are all the same rational number.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
However, if our arrows skip over
duplicates,  we can
use arrows to count the rationals as in this diagram.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="320px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/rationals3.png" alt="image: Counting the Rationals"/></div>

You can see the arrows will count all the rationals and only
the rationals.

So the rational numbers are also countable!

<h2 class="next">The Mystery of Proper Subsets</h2>

We have a seeming paradox.  On one hand <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and <span class="boldjz code">Z</span>
are size-equal.  On the other
<span class="boldjz code">N</span> is a proper subset of <span class="boldjz code">Z</span>
that seems to be much smaller because 
there are infinitely many integers in <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> that are not
included in <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> 
The paradox is only apparent, not real, because we are
judging size by two completely different standards.
One standard uses complete matchings, the other has us
thinking in terms of proper subsets.  The reason these two standards seem
to be consistent with each other is that they really are
consistent with each other&mdash;when discussing finite sets.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Thinking terms of proper subsets, we say a subset <span class="code">S'</span> is smaller
than a set <span class="code">S</span> when <span class="code">S</span> has elements missing from
<span class="code">S'</span>.  With
finite sets this means when counting <span class="code">S</span> you come to a larger
number than if you stopped after first counting <span class="code">S'</span>.  But
that explanation has no meaning when <span class="code">S</span> is infinite
because there is no end to the counting.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
If both <span class="code">S</span> and its subset <span class="code">S'</span> are infinite, then
neither set will ever be fully counted.
This makes things very different as this diagram shows

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/extraElements.png" alt="image: Infinite Subset"/></div>

Every two arrows of counting <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> becomes one arrow in
counting <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.  Both sets can have complete matchings with
<span class="boldjz code">N</span>.

By the way, super countable is not a concept.

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
The basic ideas behind the theory for comparing set sizes
presented here were established by 
the German mathematician, Georg Cantor, who was active in the
last part of the 19th century.  However
Cantor's imagination took him further than we will go.  He
defined the concept of a cardinal number that expresses the
size of a set, finite or infinite.  Because numbers don't make
much sense without arithmetic, Cantor defined a kind of
transfinite arithmetic.  As you might expect, when working
with infinite cardinalities, transfinite arithmetic is rather
weird, but when working with finite cardinalities it is consistent with the arithmetic
we already know.  
<br/><br/>
Here we use
Cantor's ideas without bothering with cardinal numbers or
transfinite arithmetic.  A theorem attributed to Ernst Schröder and
Felix Bernstein helps make this possible.
