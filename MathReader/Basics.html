<h1 class="spaced1">Basics</h1>

The material in this chapter probably contains a lot of
review.  However you ought to read all of it so you will
understand how I use symbols and language.  You needn't
memorize this material because you can always refer back to
it.

<h2 class="first">Sets</h2>

You can think of a <span class="italicjz">set</span> as a container if you like.  I do.
Nevermind the question of what a container is.   It is the
rules that we must follow when using sets are important.  Two of
the most important of these are:

<ul><li> We may not talk about something as a set unless we
believe that for every other thing there is a definitive
answer to the question of whether that other thing is
contained in (i.e. is an element of) our set.  </li><li> No set can,
directly or indirectly, contain itself.
</li></ul>

To illustrate the first rule: we will never come in contact
with the vast majority of electrons in the cosmos but we know
how to recognize electrons and we know a container
that gathers together all electrons will not contain itself.
Therefore we can talk about the set of all electrons.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The second rule may seem self-evident but experience has
shown that we still have to be careful not to violate it,
especially indirectly when we are dealing with sets within sets.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> If these rules are not satisfied, what we are talking
about isn't the right kind of container to be a set.


<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
The actual rules for working with sets are called axioms.
They are written much more symbolically than you will find
in this monograph.  Look for a course in set theory if you
want to study axioms.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div> Things that are contained in a set are called its
<span class="italicjz">elements</span> and we write <span class="code">x∊S</span> to say that <span class="code">x</span> is
an element of a set <span class="code">S</span>.

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
Sometimes I will say <span class="code">x</span> is <span class="italicjz">in</span> a set rather than
<span class="code">x</span> is an element of a set.
</div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> A set can be described by listing all its elements.
This is done with curly brackets like this:

<div  class="code_block indent display">
{<span class="code">apple,orange,pear</span>}
</div>

Sometimes our description only identifies a set's elements by
example:

<div  class="code_block indent display">
{<span class="code">1, 2, 3, ...</span>}
{<span class="code">1/1, 1/3, 1/5, ...</span>}
{<span class="code">1, 2, 3, ...,n</span>}
</div>


We can easily recognize the elements of the first two
of these sets.  The number 3.1415 is not in either of them.
The number 1,000,001 is only in the first and the number 1/21
is only in
the second.  The number 2/15 is not in any of the sets because
it fits none of their patterns.  When sets are described this
way only elements that fit the pattern are included.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The third set is different from the first two in that
it is finite.  In this context the variable <span class="code">n</span> is inferred
to be an integer representing the last listed element of the
set.  If <span class="code">n≤0</span>, the set is considered to be ∅
(aka the empty set).

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
Of course there is a potential for ambiguity with such set
descriptions.  When that is
a problem, supporting documentation must clear it up.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
A more accurate way to describe a set is to explain how to
recognize an element:

<div  class="code_block indent display">
{<span class="code"> x | x is an electron</span>}
</div>

Here is a more complicated example.


<div  class="code_block indent display">
S = {<span class="code"> i | i <span class="italicjz">is an integer</span> ∧ i&lt;0 ∧ i&gt;0 </span>}
</div>

The symbol ∧  means “and”.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
It may surprise you that this is a valid description but it is
because we can always answer the
question “is <span class="code">x∊S</span>?”  The answer is always “no”,
so <span class="code">S=∅</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
A set <span class="code">A</span> is a <span class="italicjz">subset</span> of a set <span class="code">B</span> in
case all elements of <span class="code">A</span> are elements of <span class="code">B</span> and <span class="code">A</span>
is a <span class="italicjz">proper subset</span> of <span class="code">B</span> in case <span class="code">B</span> has at least
one element that is not in <span class="code">A</span>.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Sets can contain other sets as in

<div  class="code_block indent display">
S = {<span class="code"> {<span class="code">1,a,α</span>}, {<span class="code">α,γ</span>}, -1, -2 </span>}
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
So is {<span class="code">1,a,α</span>} a subset of the <span class="code">S</span> defined
above<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
No, 
{<span class="code">1,a,α</span>}∊<span class="code">S</span> while 
1, <span class="code">a</span>, and α are elements of 
{<span class="code">1,a,α</span>}.  Other elements of <span class="code">S</span> are

<div  class="code_block indent display">
{<span class="code">α,γ</span>}
-1
-2
</div>
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Given two sets <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> some commonly used notations
are

<ul><li>
<span class="code">A<span style='font-size:120%'>⊆</span>B</span> which means <span class="code">A</span> is a subset (not
necessarily proper) of <span class="code">B</span> 
</li><li>
<span class="code">A<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0.2em;vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋃</span>B</span> which means the set of all elements in either
<span class="code">A</span> or <span class="code">B</span>. This is called the <span class="italicjz">union</span> of <span class="code">A</span> and
<span class="code">B</span>.
</li><li>
<span class="code">A<span style="vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋂</span>B</span> which means the set of all elements in both
of <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>. This is called the <span class="italicjz">intersection</span> of <span class="code">A</span> and
<span class="code">B</span>.
 
</li><li>
<span class="code">A-B</span> which means the set of all elements in <span class="code">A</span> that
are not in <span class="code">B</span>.
</li></ul>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Sets <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are <span class="italicjz">disjoint</span> in case
<span class="code">A<span style="vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋂</span>B=∅</span>, i.e. they have no element in
common.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
If <span class="cmxFont">S</span> is a set of sets, we can use the <span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0.2em;vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋃</span> symbol
to represent all the elements in all of them.  

<div  class="indent display"><span class="smalljz">
<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0;vertical-align:-10%;font-size:125%;">⋃</span><span class="cmxFont">S</span> = {<span class="code"> x | x∊Y <span class="italicjz">for some</span> Y∊<span class="cmxFont">S</span>
</span>}</span>
</div>

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
When the sets involved are infinite, it is not always obvious that
<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0;vertical-align:-10%;font-size:125%;">⋃</span><span class="code">S</span> exists.  The axioms of set theory take care of
this problem.
</div>


<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
That sets may contain sets is an important concept.  Here are two questions to
check your understanding.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
If 
<div  class="indent display">
<span class="cmxFont">S</span> = {<span class="code">{<span class="code">a,b</span>},{<span class="code">c,d,e</span>},{<span class="code">b</span>},{<span class="code">e,f</span>}</span>}
</div>

what is <span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0;vertical-align:-10%;font-size:125%;">⋃</span><span class="cmxFont">S</span><span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
{<span class="code"> a,b,c,d,e,f </span>}
<br/><br/>
One could write {<span class="code">a,b,b,c,d,e,e,f</span>} but that would be bad
form since 
<div  class="code_block indent display">
{<span class="code">a,b,b,c,d,e,e,f</span>} = {<span class="code">a,b,c,d,e,f</span>}
</div>
All we know about an element  in a set is
that it is there. There is no concept of it being there in
multiple copies and there is no way of knowing what kind of
thing it is without additional information.
</div>
<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>

For a set of sets <span class="cmxFont">S</span> and a set <span class="code">T</span> is this equality valid<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div  class="indent display">
<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0;vertical-align:-10%;font-size:125%;">⋃</span>{<span class="code">s<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub>|i∊<span class="cmxFont">S</span></span>}<span style="vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋂</span><span class="code">T</span> = <span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0;vertical-align:-10%;font-size:125%;">⋃</span>{<span class="code">s<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub><span style="vertical-align:10%; font-size:50%;">⋂</span>T|i∊<span class="cmxFont">S</span></span>}
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="boldjz">answer</span>
<div  class="indent display">
Yes, in both cases the resulting set's elements are only those
found in one of <span class="code">S</span>'s sets and in <span class="code">T</span>.
</div>



<h2 class="next">Tuples</h2>

Tuples exist so that we can have multiple copies of an element
in a container.
Tuples list their elements in a specific order.  There are a
couple consequences of giving each element a position:

<ul><li>
Tuples can contain multiple copies of the same element.
</li><li>
Rearranging the elements of a tuple creates a different tuple. 
</li></ul>

So these are all different tuples

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(a,b,c,a)
(c,b,a,a)
(b,a,c)
</div>

The first two of these tuples are <span class="italicjz">4-tuples</span>, the third is
a <span class="italicjz">3-tuple</span>.
When a tuple has just two values, as in <span class="code">(x,y)</span>, it is
called a <span class="italicjz">pair</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
What is the difference between the following<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<ol><li>
<span class="code">x,y∊S</span>
</li><li>
<span class="code">(x,y)∊S</span>
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
The first says both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>
are element of <span class="code">S</span> and the second says that the pair
<span class="code">(x,y)</span> is an element of <span class="code">S</span>.
</div>


<h2 class="next">Variables</h2>

Variables name things.  We use them much like we use any name.
When we have a friend named “Bob”,
we use that name to refer to him. But the name has an
existence of its own, and in other contexts it may refer to
other people.  Or we may know the name “Bob” without
knowing anybody with that name. For example, “Is there a
Bob here?”

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So it is with variables. They can refer to a
particular value in one context and another value in a
different context.  

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
Sometimes when a variable refers to a value, I will 
say it <span class="code">is</span> that value.  
</div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> When the value of a variable is unknown we have a known
unknown on our hands.  An analogous example in real life is
looking for a criminal named “John Doe”.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
If <span class="code">X={<span class="code">apple,pear,orange</span>}</span>, does <span class="code">X</span> have just one
value<span class="boldjz code">??</span>.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="boldjz">answer</span>
<div  class="indent display">
Yes, and that value is a set.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Here are some facts about variables.
When we say that a variable <span class="code">x</span> 

<ul><li>
is assigned a value, we mean that <span class="code">x</span> is going 
to refer to that value until the context changes.
</li><li>
is arbitrary, we mean that, although <span class="code">x</span> has one particular
value, we do not know what
that value is. 
</li><li>
depends on other variables, we mean the value <span class="code">x</span> refers to can be
deduced
when we know what all those other variables refer to.
</li><li>
can have one of two values, we
mean that  <span class="code">x</span>'s value, while unknown, has been
narrowed down to two possibilities.  
</li></ul>


<h2 class="next">Sequences</h2>

A sequence is rather like a tuple.  In both cases there will
be a first element, a second element, and so on.  But
sequences are written without parentheses and there may be
infinitely many elements in them.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So
<div  class="code_block indent display">
(1,2,1,3,2,4,3)
</div>

is a tuple but these are sequences

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1,2,1,3,2,4,3
1,2,3,…,n
1,2,4,8,…
</div>

The first of these sequences has 7 elements, the second has
<span class="code">n</span> elements where the actual number of elements is not
known, and the third has infinitely many elements.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The last two of these sequences are written with an ellipse
“…”.  When that is done, the sequence ought to exhibit a
pattern that we can use to predict the missing elements.  For
the second sequence, the pattern requires that the next element is always
one larger.  For the third sequence, the pattern requires that
next element be two
times its predecessor.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
An infinite sequence of unknowns looks like

<div  class="code_block indent display">
s<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>,s<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub>,s<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub>,…
</div>

where each <span class="code">s<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span> is a separate variable name which we
read as “s sub <span class="code">i</span>” in general or as “s sub 1”, “s
sub 2”, etc. for particular variables.

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
Traditionally the subscripts start with 1.
However with the influence of computer programming,
counting may start with 0.  In this monograph though, we always start counting
with 1.
</div>

<h2 class="next">Numbers</h2>

We all have been taught to
visualize our number system on a line like this:

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="80px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/MathReader/images/realNumberLine.png" alt="image: The Real Number Line"/></div>

There are no breaks in this line. That means for any two numbers
<span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> and <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span> with <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&lt;n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span> there will be another
number <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub></span> such that <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&lt;n<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub>&lt;n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span>.  This is true no
matter how close <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span> is to <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span>.  This is
called a <span class="italicjz">density</span> property.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Numbers like 27.23 are
called
“real numbers”.  I will use <span class="boldjz code">R</span> to refer to the
set of all of them.  Usually when I say “number” I mean a
real number.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Given two numbers <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> and
<span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span> such that <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&lt;n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span>.  Can you show that, no matter how
close together <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> and <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span> are, there is an infinite
sequence of numbers <span class="code">c<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>,c<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub>,c<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub>,…</span> that lie strictly
between <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> and <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span><span class="boldjz code">??</span>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
Think of this as
a puzzle.  And try to forget any incantations you learned in
math class.  Simply use the density property to explain a process for generating
infinitely many numbers between <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> and
<span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span>. 
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<ul><li>
Choose <span class="code">c<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> such that <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&lt;c<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&lt;n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span> using the density

(Therefore <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&lt;c<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&lt;c<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub>&lt;n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span>.)

Continue choosing numbers this way getting an
unending sequence of distinct numbers between <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> and <span class="code">n<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span>.
</li></ul>

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
Of course you could have chosen the <span class="code">c<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> such

and so on.
</div>



<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div> Two subsets of <span class="boldjz code">R</span> are important for us

<ul><li>
The natural numbers
<div  class="indent display">
<span class="boldjz code">N</span> = {<span class="code">1,2,3,…</span>}.  
</div>
The integers
<div  class="indent display">
<span class="boldjz code">Z</span> = {<span class="code">…,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,…</span>}.
</div>
</li></ul>

Although <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> subsets of the real numbers, we will often think
of them as separate sets.  

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div> Here are some things about numbers you may have forgotten.

<ul><li>
All numbers can be expressed with infinitely many fractional
digits.  
</li><li>
When those fractional digits end with an unending string of
0<span class="smalljz">s</span> as in 1.000… or as in 0.125000…,  the
0<span class="smalljz">s</span> at the end can be left off as in 1 or 0.125.
</li><li>
A number like a 0.999… or 2.3499… (i.e.  one that
ends with an unending string of 9<span class="smalljz">s</span>) isn't a separate
number.  Instead these numbers are the same as the next
larger number, i.e.  0.999… is 1 and
2.3499… is 2.35.  This isn't rounding.  It's a quirk of
the way we write down numbers.
</li><li>
Some fractions are unfinished whenever we write them
down with fractional digits.  That is to say no matter how many
fractional digits we write down, we are expressing an
approximation. For example 1/3 is 0.333… .  Since we
cannot do arithmetic with infinitely many fractional digits we
are always approximating 1/3.

For some of the unfinished numbers (e.g. π) we cannot even predict what
all the factional digits will look like.  (You may have
learned the name “irrational” to describe such
numbers.)

A math major is likely to take an entire semester course on
the development of our number system.  Here I skip over that
development and rely on our
common understanding so you can
read examples of mathematical reasoning as applied to topics
outside the usual mathematics major.
