               A version of this workspace has been used twice in 
          Hille Institute summer workshops for middle school teachers
          at the Oklahoma School of Science and Math.  The lab sheet
          used at the 2007 workship is

Here's what the workspace module does for you:



<ul>





<P/><li>Lets you use a popup file chooser window to pick your current 

folder.

</li>







<P/><li>Lets you use a popup text editor to enter and alter

function and (small) class definitions.

</li>







<P/><li>Lets you save the current workspace today so you can restore

it tomorrow.

</li>





</ul>



</p><p>



Unlike with (at least some) IDEs, editing is not module oriented.  This

is an advantage when you are tinkering and a disadvantage when you

are building something large.



</p><p>



This module requires version 2.4 or later of Python. The Tkinter module

is required for full functionality. Python's Windows installer will

arrange for both.

Handed out at the Hille Institute workshop for middle school teachers, held at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, June 2007.  This is a complete distribution of Python 2.4 that has been modified to load the workspace module and to run from any (Windows) drive including a flash drive.

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Saving and Loading</b></p>

<p>



Saving the workspace means to place a memory of the current

workspace in the current folder.  Do it this way



<pre>



>>> save()

>>>

</pre>





</p><hr align="center" width="30%" /><p>



What to do if you do not want to save all the variables in your

current workspace?  Delete the ones you do not want.  For example,



<pre>



>>> z = -1

>>> z

-1

>>> del z

>>> z

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?

NameError: name 'z' is not defined

>>>

</pre>





</p><hr align="center" width="30%" /><p>



How can you remember which variables are in the current workspace?

If you are me, you cannot.  So ask



<pre>



>>> savable()



Global Variables: ['x','y']

Functions: []

Classes: []

Modules: []



>>>

</pre>





In this case there are two savable variables, named &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo;.  There are no savable functions, modules, or classes.  Here the rules

for what is savable:



</p><dl><dd><p>



<strong>Variables</strong>



<dl><dd>

To be savable, a variable must refer to savable value.  Numeric and string primitives are savable values.  Other savable values are

defined recursively:  lists and tuples of savable values are

savable; dicts are savable if their keys are primitives and their

values are savable.

</dd></dl>

</p><p>

<strong>Functions</strong>

<dl><dd>

The only savable functions are those defined with <tt>edit()</tt>.

</dd></dl>

</p><p>

<strong>Classes</strong>

<dl><dd>

The only savable classes are those defined with <tt>edit()</tt>.

</dd></dl>

</p><p>



<strong>Modules</strong>

<dl><dd>

The only savable modules are those imported with <tt>import</tt> &lt;<i>module name</i>&gt;.

</dd></dl>

</p>

</dd></dl>

<p>

</p><hr align="center" width="30%" /><p>



Now suppose it is tomorrow and you want to start where you left

off.  Assuming you entered the <tt>save()</tt> command before you closed

the Python window, you can restart Python, import the

workspace module, and then do this



<pre>



>>> load()

Clear the existing workspace before loading? (answer y,

n, or ?) n



The following have been loaded from the unnamed_workspace workspace

(If you cleared the current workspace, the following is all there is.)



Global Variables: ['x','y']

Functions: []

Classes: []

Modules: []



>>>

</pre>





After you enter <tt>load()</tt>, the loading mechanism asks you if you want

to clear out the current workspace before proceeding. Since you haven't

done anything in the current workspace, it doesn't matter how you

answer. I answered with &ldquo;n&rdquo;. (All I entered in the above example were

<tt>load()</tt> and <tt>n</tt>.)



</p><p>



The load mechanism continues by telling you that it is working with an

unnamed workspace and by listing the things it has loaded.  In this

case, it is again the two variables named &ldquo;x&rdquo; an &ldquo;y&rdquo;.  They

will also have the values you gave them yesterday.



</p><hr align="center" width="30%" /><p>



Both <tt>save()</tt> and <tt>load()</tt> can take an argument which names the workspace you are saving or loading.   Without this argument, the file

containing workspace information is &ldquo;unnamed_workspace.pws&rdquo; in

the current directory.  With the argument the file will be the one

you named, but for an appended suffix of <tt>.pws</tt>.



</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Changing Directories</b></p>

<p>



Enter &ldquo;changeFolder()&rdquo; and you will see



</p><p>

<center><image src="changeFolder.gif" width="80%"></center>

</p><p>



The popup window is a file chooser window.   The current

folder is highlighted in that window and you are given a chance

to change it.  Changing it will change the current directory your

interpreter is working in.



</p><p>



You can also see which directory is current with <tt>changeFolder()</tt>

because it always highlights the current directory as it pops up

the file chooser window.





</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Editing Functions and Classes</b></p>

<p>



Instead of typing <tt>def</tt> and <tt>class</tt> definitions directly

into the command line interpreter, you can use the edit command.

Execute



<pre>



>>> edit()

</pre>





What you will see is a new window something like this



</p><p>



<center><image src="editor.gif" width="80%"></center>



</p><p>



Enter a single function or class definition into the top part of

this window. The <tt>check</tt> button compiles it and shows messages

in the bottom part.  (If necessary, you can scroll with the arrow keys.)



</p><p>



Compiling from this window is required if you are to load your

definition back into the Python interpreter. The window is modal, you

cannot use the command line window until you are finished with it.

(You can, however, use windows from other applications.)



</p><p>



Advantages:



<ul>





<P/><li>Compared with (at least some) IDEs, this method of entering functions

and classes provides the advantage of letting you enter and reenter

definitions as freely as you could by retyping the <tt>def</tt> and

<tt>class</tt> commands.

</li>









<P/><li>Compared with retyping the <tt>def</tt> and <tt>class</tt> commands, this

method of entering functions and classes avoids the need for retyping

everything.

</li>







<P/><li>Definitions entered this way work with the <tt>save()</tt> and <tt>load()</tt>

workspace commands.

</li>





</ul>



To re-edit an existing definition of <tt>foo</tt>, enter



<pre>



>>> edit(foo)
