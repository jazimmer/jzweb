<H2>Accept your limitations without succumbing to them</H2>

   Our most obvious limitations are physical.  None of us can fly
like a bat or swim like a dolphin.    Worse, all human adults can
look forward to a future of declining physical prowess.  Accepting
these limitations without succumbing to them is the art of living
and growing old gracefully.
<P>
   This goal applies to nonphysical limitations as well.  Human
knowledge is limited and, worse, not everything we think we know
is true.  Making the best of our flawed knowledge is as important
as dealing with our other limitations.
<P>
   Not knowing the full extent of your limitations is, of course,
one of the limitations you must accept without succumbing to.
