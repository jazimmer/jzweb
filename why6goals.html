Imagine two neighbors of different religions, cultures, or races.  Are they living comfortably 
together or is one trying to get the other to move away?  If the latter, is the effort subtle or vicious?  
We’ve seen recent examples of a vicious effort; it was called ethnic cleansing.  Ethnic cleansing is 
an extreme response to distrust and dislike between neighbors of different backgrounds.

<P>
Now, suppose each neighbor knows that both are trying to live up to these six goals, that the six 
goals are respected by people of both backgrounds.   Each neighbor becomes aware of significant 
aspirations that both have in common.  Do you still see one neighbor trying to get the other to move 
away?  It could happen but it is a lot less likely, isn’t it?
<P>
I wrote these goals for myself but, at the same time, I tried to create goals that people of almost 
any religious belief or nonbelief would love to be able to live up to.  That's because I wanted both 
those neighbors to find these goals appealing.   I wanted goals that would stretch me in significant 
ways but I also wanted goals that would let people of different backgrounds be aware of significant 
shared aspirations.
<P>
<I>Most people will be able to think of a significant goal that is not present among my six.</I>  The 
reason may be that I felt that there are plenty of good and honest people in the world who would 
not quite agree with that goal.  The reason also may be that I felt that goal was covered well 
enough by the others.  Finally, the reason may be that I made a mistake.
<P>
The fact that I didn't simply copy the Ten Commandments is due to the first reason.  Much of the 
world does not belong to any of the great religions which grew from the Old Testament.  I wanted 
to reach everybody without taking the time to explain things like how people can believe one must 
not kill and yet still go to war.
<P>
There are no goals among these six that explicitly prohibit lying or murder.  The reason is not that 
many good and honest people would disagree with such goals.  Rather, the reason is that these two  
goals are covered pretty well by the other six:  you cannot tell a serious lie or commit murder while 
trying to exercise your will in harmony with others and  while trying not to hurt them.
<P>
The second goal, "neither hurt others nor be overly touchy",  is more flexible than "thou shalt not 
kill".  It forces you to balance killing against other kinds of hurt.  It admits that there may be 
circumstances (such as war) in which killing is justified.   I have the utmost respect for those would 
never kill under any circumstances but few people aspire to such sainthood.
<P>
The third reason you may know of a significant goal that I have missed is that I may have made a 
mistake.   This possibility may cause you to ask "who are you to be writing such daily goals?"  My 
only answer is "a curious soul who has knocked around the world a bit."  It is a weak answer to a 
poor question.  The worth of these daily goals is not lessened because I am a nobody who cannot 
always achieve his own goals.  The worth of these daily goals is determined by the variety of 
people who find them to be appealing and significant and who aspire to achieving them.
<P>
Ask whether you think you could improve yourself by trying for these goals.  Then, ask whether 
you could find some common ground with anybody else who is sincerely working towards these 
goals.  My feeling is that your answers to these questions will be "yes" and "probably".
