<p>
Why study mathematics or computer science if you are going to be, say, a
movie director?
</p><p>
Because a movie involves creating lots of pieces that must
fit together: script, set, cinematography,
costuming, acting abilities, etc.
</p><p>
Or suppose you want to be a physician, then why?
</p><p>
Because a physician must plan the activities of nurses and 
medical technicians.  The work of these helpers must be
well coordinated with the plan of diagnosis or treatment.  
A medical practice is more routine than making a 
movie.
Even so
the need to do things differently does arise and when
routines are changed the need for them to work correctly
the first time is greater than on a movie set. 
</p><p>
Practicing creative mathematics or computer programming
can improve your ability to make complicated
plans that just work.
