 I had the pleasure of taking three courses, a directed study and a
 mentorship with Dr. Zimmer. He gave me a superb knowledge of computer
 science, which allowed me to enroll in 400-level college courses and
 get a position working in a research lab in my first summer after
 graduating high school. In my first week of classes and work, I
 repeatedly found myself well prepared to meet and surpass the
 expectations of me. Not only did Dr. Zimmer do an extraordinary job
 teaching the required course material, but he also taught the ability
 to critically analyze problems and their solutions.

 I have learned a lot throughout my educational career, but the one skill set that has proved invaluable to me throughout my time at MIT and my work at Intel is the ability to think abstractly, which I gained from working with Dr. Zimmer.

Our independent study at OSSM was of great value to me.  It was probably the
single best thing I did the entire time I was there, and was a pretty
massive step forward in my understanding of the field.  I learned pretty
much the entire foundation of programming languages from that study.  The
things I learned in that study applied pretty broadly to my future studies
in computer science and really paved the way for my career.

Dr. Zimmer taught me quite a few things when I studied with him, but perhaps
the most important thing he taught me won't be found in any textbook: it was
to look at a problem from all angles, to see new solutions to problems.  The
skills I learned working with him have served me well, both in research and
in industry, and I highly recommend him to any student who is interested in
either path.

Both of our children studied programming with Dr. Zimmer at Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics.  In fact, they  took at least one Computer Science course with him every semester.  In addition, he worked with them on a mentorship project, a summer research program, and tutored for programming competitions.  They are now both now Computer Science majors at Rice University.  What they have told us is that the creative problem solving skills learned from Dr. Zimmer have put them way ahead of their classmates.  Our oldest child, a junior, has said that many of the programming concepts presented to him by Dr. Zimmer because of their depth have not been presented yet in any of his college Computer Science classes!

I have supervised Dr. Zimmer's teaching of computer science and sometimes
theoretical mathematics for 10 years now. His teaching style is informal and
versatile. He engages student interest with stories from his long experience
and his constant nontechnical reading. He treats students as responsible
individuals with interests and learning styles of their own.   Students are
provided with challenging work and expected to make an honest effort.
They generally fulfill that expectation and finish his classes with
improved analytical skills.
