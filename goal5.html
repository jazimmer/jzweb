<H2>Exercise your will in harmony with others</H2>

   Although we like to have our own way, some of our greatest
satisfaction comes from accomplishing things with others.  
Learning to mesh our varied ideas about how to do things is one 
of the most difficult and potentially rewarding of human 
accomplishments.  When you stumble, you can be sure there will
be another chance.  Keep at it.
<P>
   Following this goal is what permits two or more people to 
create things beyond the vision of any one of them -- they become 
more than the sum of their parts.
<P>
   To have your own way within the dual constraints of your own
limitations and the willfulness of others, what better practice
for learning this could there be than living a human life?  Don't
waste the opportunity.
