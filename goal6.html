<H2>Respect your world but do not venerate it</H2>
<P>
Our world is not just the blue ball where we live, it is also those
social institutions which help us share our blue ball.  He who throws
trash in the ocean disrespects his world; she who lobbies for a
lucrative government contract to build something of little value also
disrespects her world.
<P>
Such disrespect spreads like a disease; from one action by one person it can spread to many people.  
When the disease becomes epidemic, something valuable dies.  Don't spread the disease of 
disrespect.
<P>
We venerate things that are almost perfect, things we want to remain the
same.  Our world isn't 
finished changing.  It thrives on change.  Don't venerate it -- that will make you oppose change 
merely because it is change.
