<P>&nbsp;<P><P><B>Some short comparisons:</B><P><UL>
<P>
<LI> The ACM document was drawn up by a committee and the zio package
was created by an individual.<P>
<LI> The ACM proposal includes some descriptions of software that does
not seem to exist. The zio package exists.<P>
<LI> The ACM proposal is more ambitious.  The zio package is <I>much</I>
smaller but makes up for that by integrating with Swing and AWT.<P>
<LI> Both systems recognize a value in console I/O for beginning
students. Both provide class that simplify such I/O.<P>
<LI> Both systems recognize a value in a classes for simple GUI
dialogs. The ACM system (called IODialog) is similar to Java's dialog
boxes. The zio system contains a DisplayWindow class for display of text
and images and a DialogWindow class for single line text entry and
response. (DialogWindow is something like the console window without the
visible history.)<P>
<LI> The ACM console I/O classes are just for console I/O.
The zio console I/O classes use the same methods on text files
(and strings and sockets for that matter). <P>
<LI> The ACM console writing classes are overloaded to the hilt
so that students do not have to stay aware of what data type
they are working with.  The zio package forces students to
do explicit conversions.  (A hassle, yes.  But better trained
students come from it.)<P>
<LI> Both were prepared with a transition to Java's own Swing and
AWT in mind.  The ACM prepares for this transition by not straying too far from Java's way of doing things.  The zio package encourages
transition by encouraging the integration of AWT and Swing classes with zio classes.<P>
<LI> Both systems enable users to do I/O without knowing about I/O
exceptions..
<P>&nbsp;<P><P>
</UL><P><B>Some longer comments:</B><P>My <I>first</I> comment is about the risk you take adopting the zio
package.  Can a package supported by one person be as safe to adopt as
one supported by many people and two institutions (ACM and Sun)?<P>NO and YES. <P>No, because one person cannot consider all ramifications of
what he is creating or provide backup support for himself.  <P>Yes, because zio is a small, well-documented, open-source system.
&#8220;Small&#8221 is the keyword here. That word means:<P><OL>
<P>
<LI> It wouldn't be that hard for another person to take zio
over if necessary.  <P>
<LI> Students will not be putting so much learning capital into
zio as into the ACM system.  Remember <I>both</I> systems are intended
to be set aside when the student gets more advanced.<P>
<LI> You need spend less time away from your existing textbook.
There are no texbooks for either system but the smaller zio package
integrates with things taught in existing books about Swing and
AWT.<P>
</OL>
<P>&nbsp;<P><P>My <I>second</I> comment concerns file I/O. Perhaps, I missed it but I
haven't seen it in the ACM proposal. File I/O in Java is very flexible
and very complicated. File I/O is also something with which beginners
should have a little experience. The zio package offers it for text
files in a form that is identical to the console I/O and it offers it
(along with digital image I/O) with methods that perform whole file I/O.<P>Whole file I/O didn't use to be a common phenomenon. With the memory
capacity of today's machines, it has become common in scripting
languages.  There are also good pedagogical reasons for using it:
once you get that file into memory you have to get it into a form 
you can use and that usually means some kind of array.  The
bottom line here is that if you use whole file I/O you need say
very little about I/O and you have another excuse for emphasizing
arrays.  I do think the ACM proposal was remiss in not including
this feature.  Of course, they can still add it but remember the
virtues of <I>small</I>?
<P>&nbsp;<P><P>My <I>third</I> comment is that, even though I was unaware of the ACM
proposal until today, it is interesting how similar my thinking was to
the ACM committee's. The short comparisons above show this similarity
and so does a look at the committee's concerns about the Java language.
Here are the first two they list:<P>The ACM committee's first Java language concern, which they label L1, is
that students are confused by what should be static and what should not.
This was on my mind as I created zio. With my students, I distinguish
between two kinds of classes: method defining (which exist only to
define a set of actions that can be used independently of each other)
and object defining (which exist only to define objects, that is data
with a set of methods for manipulating that data). In method defining
classes all methods are static. In object-defining classes all methods
are not static. Instance variables, too, are static in method defining
classes and nonstatic in object defining classes.  However, instance
variables are very rare in method defining classes, mostly being
limited to the definition of constants.<P>Clearly this dichotomy is not the way the Java API does things but it 
is a convenient fiction and, as of July 13, 2005, the public and
protected methods and variables in the zio package fit entirely
into this fictional world.<P>When teaching Java the one time where I find I <I>must</I> talk about
classes that have both method-defining and object-defining
characteristics is with number formatting. Because the zio package
supports formatted output on the console and on text files, I can put
this awful day off to the end of the semester.  <P>The ACM committee's second Java language concern, which they label L2,
is the way Java forces beginners to be aware of exceptions. Both the ACM
committee and I judged this to be unacceptable.<P>The committee has other concerns but it was with the first two that
I felt the greatest resonance.
<P>&nbsp;<P><P>My <I>fourth</I> comment concerns the fact that the zio package does
not encapsulate Swing and/or AWT.  This is the price that needs to
be paid in order to get an incremental transition from zio to the
Java API's way of doing things. It is a price that the designers
of the ACM proposal were not willing to pay.<P>Personally, I think it is a small price. Encapsulation is a software
maintenance issue and I am as concerned about maintenance issues as the
rest of you. (Probably even more so, after all I did serve on the
editorial board of the Journal of Software Maintenance for a decade.)
But I believe we are starting to overdo encapsulation in our beginning
courses.<P>We emphasize encapsulation in the hope that programmers trained with
Good Practices from day one will take the time to design in fully
encapsulated patterns when pressures for quick solutions are on them. It
is probably a vain hope. Future programmers will remember how much of a
hassle it was to encapsulate things and they will still start their
careers without the kind of experience that shows why the encapsulation
hassle pays off.<P>Furthermore, it is real questionable whether the hassle does pay
off when the program is quite small and for individual use. Do remember,
we are teaching beginners, not software engineers.  Most of those
beginners will not become software engineers; they will write 
small programs for individual use.
<P>&nbsp;<P><P>My <I>fifth</I> comment is that the ACM system does nothing to help
high school students compete in the USACO contests. My students have
used zio's Input and Output classes in the online contests that occur
monthly during the year. They have had to cut and paste the source code
into their programs and mark the insertion as "not written during the
contest". Still without some help from you, your students will not be
able to do the I/O required in these contests. The zio package helps you
give that help.<P>&nbsp;<P><P>I intend to get a comment mechanism built into these web pages some day.
For now, you'll have to settle for writing me and hoping I'll be moved
to incorporate your ideas (with or without attribution as you wish) into
these web pages. Write to mmmyy@jazimmer.net where mmm=jan,feb,... and
yy is the last two digits of the year.)<P><P><P><PRE></PRE><P><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD ALIGN="left" WIDTH="15%"><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="teachers.html">context</A></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="center" WIDTH="40%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Jul 13, 2005</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="right" WIDTH="15%"><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="http://jazimmer.net/">author</A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
