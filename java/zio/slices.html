of thinking in slices does give you, the programmer, better control over the
layout of objects in your windows. Moreover, as I hope to show here, that
better control extends over the lifetime of the window as the user resizes it.<P>I introduced slicing as a concept in
<A HREF="http://www.mapfree.com/sbf/tcl/book/home.html">Tcl/Tk for
Programmers</A> in 1998. At that time, slicing was useful but only in
planning your window layouts. Today, Java programmers can have API
support for slicing through the zio package described here. This
package is layered on top of Swing's <CODE>BoxLayout</CODE> layout manager. The
layering adds very little overhead and a lot of helpful structure.<P>First the concept.  Consider the following window that
contains nine squares.<P><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="Nines.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><P>You can organize the squares into rows. That gives you three rows, the
entire window is sliced horizontally. The three rows fit into one
column. Your window is organized into four slices, one column
containing three rows. Or you can organize the squares into three
columns and put the three columns into one row. Again, four slices with
one containing the other three.<P>Finally, you can organize this window into a grid of nine squares.
Although it is much easier to say "organize this window into a grid of
nine squares" than to speak of four slices, grids are usually more
difficult to work with than slices. The reason is that you usually find
yourself coalescing some grid elements into one entity. Consider this
example involving a text entry area with a couple buttons.<P><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="Textarea.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><P>This window does not make a neat grid but it does slice quite easily: it
was created as one row containing two columns.  Something like this:<P><TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="LeftHand.gif"></TD><TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="RightHand.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><P>The left hand
column contains two buttons. The right hand column contains three things
of which the text area is only the largest.  The two smaller things are
again slices.  They look like this<P><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="Boxes.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><P>This example was created with a total of five slices, an outer row, two
inside columns, and&#151;within one of the columns&#151;two
innermost rows. Rows are horizontal slices, columns are vertical. There
is no essential difference between the two: any description of a row is
also a description of a column if you transpose the horizontal and
vertical directions. If we transpose rows with columns in the above
example we get<P><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="Transposed.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><P><B>Expanding Slices:</B><P>The above windows look the same as the user expands the windows.
They do not permit the user to shrink the windows to a point where
they become useless.  Achieving such behavior in Swing is often
quite difficult.  Making it easier was one of the goals behind
the zio package.<P>Slicing is the key. Once you understand how a slice expands, you can
build more complicated windows out of slices and understand them as
well. This section will get you started. A newer feature, the gridded
slice, is not explained here but enables rows and columns of a grid to
behave in uniform ways. The next example of a row of boxes shows the
normal way for a slice to expand.<P><TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="SmallBoxes.gif"></TD><TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="LargeBoxes.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><P>Well, actually, that is one of two normal ways for a slice to expand.
It is the kind of expansion you get when none of the objects in the
slice expands. If one of the objects in the slice can expand in the
direction of the slice, then the spaces remain rigid and the slice
expands through its expanding objects something like this:<P><TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR><TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="SmallBoxes.gif"></TD><TD WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center"><IMG VSPACE="20" SRC="ExpandingBoxes.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><P>Normal expansion explains how the two innermost rows of boxes in the text
entry example expand.  It also explains how the leftmost column expands.
It almost explains how the other two slices expand but not quite.  The
problem is that while a slice is mostly a one dimensional thing, it is not
wholly a one dimensional thing.  Before discussing the difference let's
consider the zio package.<P><B>The zio Package:</B><P>This package consists of <P><UL>
<P>
<LI> a potpourri class <CODE>Zio</CODE> that contains some useful static methods,<P>
<LI> two classes <CODE>Input</CODE> and <CODE>Output</CODE> for text I/O, <P>
<LI> one class <CODE>InOut</CODE> for whole file I/O.  (The <CODE>InOut</CODE> class can handle
text or images.), and<P>
<LI> several classes for GUI programming.<P>
</UL><P>The GUI classes are of three kinds<P><UL>
<P>
<LI> A <CODE>ZWindow</CODE> class that creates windows, arranges for the
program to stop when the user closes the last window, and performs 
other window-related tasks.<P>
<LI> Two slice classes <CODE>ZRow</CODE> and <CODE>ZCol</CODE><P>
<LI> Several classes representing screen objects.  Examples of screen
objects are the buttons and the text area shown above.  The zio
package has a small collection of classes for defining such screen
objects.  For kinds of screen object not supported, it has a 
<CODE>ZComponent</CODE> class
that can bring Swing objects into the zio system.
See below in the section &#8220;Placing Swing Objects into ZComponents&#8221.<P>
</UL><P>The package has two levels of documentation
<A HREF="http://jazimmer.net/source_code/java/zio/basic_doc/index.html">basic</A> 
for beginners and
<A HREF="http://jazimmer.net/source_code/java/zio/flexible_doc/index.html">complete</A> 
for the rest of us.  The beginners' version of the documentation leaves
out some methods and classes and also simplifies some of the explanations.
It will get you started just fine.  When you need more detail, switch
to the complete documentation.<P>All the classes representing objects that appear on the screen are subclasses
of <CODE>ZObject</CODE>.  So are the <CODE>ZRow</CODE> and <CODE>ZCol</CODE> classes.  Any of these
things can be used in the zio package where a <CODE>ZObject</CODE> is required.
Putting <CODE>ZObject</CODE>s into <CODE>ZRow</CODE>s and <CODE>ZCol</CODE>s is the way you build
windows, slice by slice.<P>Here is a Java method that creates a row of squares as required above.<P><CODE>private&nbsp;static&nbsp;ZRow&nbsp;border(int&nbsp;n,&nbsp;Color&nbsp;boxColor)&nbsp;{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZBox&nbsp;[]&nbsp;zpary&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZBox&nbsp;[n];<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(int&nbsp;i=0;&nbsp;i&lt;zpary.length;&nbsp;i+=1)&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zpary[i]&nbsp;=&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZBox().size(new&nbsp;Dimension(6,6)).color(boxColor);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZRow(&nbsp;zpary&nbsp;).atLeft().atRight();<BR>}<BR><BR>
</CODE><P>This places <CODE>n</CODE> newly created <CODE>ZBox</CODE>s into a newly created
<CODE>ZRow</CODE>. Along the way there are adjustments are made to the
<CODE>ZBox</CODE>s and the <CODE>ZRow</CODE> as follows:<P><UL>
<P>
<LI> The newly created <CODE>ZBox</CODE>s have their default size and color modified
with the two methods <CODE>size()</CODE> and <CODE>color()</CODE>.<P>
<LI> The newly created <CODE>ZRow</CODE> has its margins on the left and right removed
with the two methods <CODE>atLeft()</CODE> and <CODE>atRight()</CODE>.<P>
</UL><P>A method which makes such a modification is called
a <I>suffix</I>.<P>By the way, the size and color adjustments require parameters of
type <CODE>Dimension</CODE> and <CODE>Color</CODE>.
A <CODE>Dimension</CODE> consists of a width and a height (both measure in 
pixels) and a <CODE>Color</CODE> consists of three numbers given its red, green,
and blue content.  (These two classes are from Java's API.  You can read
about them at
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Dimension.html">Dimension
</A> and
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">Color</A>.)<P><P><B>Suffixes:</B><P>Suffixes are like adjectives that follow their nouns.  The nouns
are <CODE>ZObjects</CODE>.  The adjectives can come in any order.  They
can appear with any occurence of the noun <I>before</I> the window
containing that <CODE>ZObject</CODE> is created.  This rule is enforced
by zio's runtime system.<P>There are two places in the <CODE>border</CODE> method, where suffixes
are used:<P><CODE>new&nbsp;ZBox().size(new&nbsp;Dimension(6,6)).color(boxColor);<BR>
</CODE><P>and<P><CODE>new&nbsp;ZRow(&nbsp;zpary&nbsp;).atLeft().atRight();<BR>
</CODE><P>The four suffixes: <CODE>size()</CODE>, <CODE>color()</CODE>, <CODE>atLeft()</CODE>,
and <CODE>atRight()</CODE> are rather self-explanatory as good adjectives
should be.  Possibly  <CODE>atLeft()</CODE> needs more
explanation: it says the leftmost object in the row should appear
at the very left of the row.  Of course, <CODE>atRight()</CODE> is similar
but on the other side of the row.<P>These four suffixes define modifications to their <CODE>ZObjects</CODE> (a
<CODE>ZBox</CODE> in the first instance and a <CODE>ZRow</CODE> in the second) that
are carried out before the window containing the object is created.<P>The zio package has quite a few suffixes. Some of them like, <CODE>size()</CODE>
and <CODE>color()</CODE>, take parameters; some, like <CODE>atLeft()</CODE> and
<CODE>atRight()</CODE> do not. You can think of those suffixes that do take
parameters as giving me a way to add optional parameters to a
<CODE>ZObject</CODE>'s constructor. You can think of those suffixes that do not
take parameters as a replacement for the flag parameters found in some
other contexts. (A common place where such constructors are used is in
opening files. Thinking in suffixes we would have <CODE>readonly()</CODE> and
<CODE>writeonly()</CODE> suffixes. Instead, what is common is to think in flags
and so have something like <CODE>READ_ONLY</CODE> and <CODE>WRITE_ONLY</CODE> static
final ints that must be or'd together.)<P>Suffixes, therefore, are a way of adding flexibility to constructors
that cuts down the need for overloading and removes the need for flags.
Not surprisingly, the zio package makes no use of flags and very little
use of overloading. <P>One useful zio suffix that is available for all kinds of <CODE>ZObject</CODE>s is
<CODE>debug()</CODE>.   You make up a name for the <CODE>ZObject</CODE> and pass
that name to <CODE>debug()</CODE>.  When the window is created, the command window
will show some debug information about that object.  For example,<P><CODE>new&nbsp;ZBox().debug("default&nbsp;box");<BR>
</CODE><P>Will show you the default size  and color of the box you have 
identified as &#8220;default box&#8221.<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Full Disclosure:</B>  <P><OL>


<LI>
Now that you know
about suffixes, I can confess that in the above example where
I transposed rows and columns, I also had to
to replace <CODE>atLeft()</CODE> and <CODE>atRight()</CODE> suffixes with  <CODE>atTop()</CODE> and
<CODE>atBottom()</CODE> suffixes.

<LI>
I have been able to implement suffixes for
<CODE>ZObject</CODE>s because such objects are actually created when the
window containing them is created.  For files, I have no such 
mechansim.  The zio package avoids the <CODE>READ_ONLY</CODE> and
<CODE>WRITE_ONLY</CODE> flags in a completely different and rather 
uninteresting way.

</FONT><P><B>Placing Swing Objects within ZObjects:</B><P>If you are a beginner, stop reading here, back up (or link to 
<A HREF="http://jazimmer.net/source_code/java/zio.html">context</A>),
and look at the educational examples.<P>If you are an expert, some of the objects you place into a <CODE>ZWindow</CODE> will be normal Swing objects.  This is because zio  provides a 
quite limited set of classes for screen objects. The value of zio
for you is primarily in layout management and only secondarily in the
simplicity of using classes like <CODE>ZTextlines</CODE> or <CODE>ZKeyboard</CODE> over
their Swing counterparts.  
Let's continue the text entry
example by showing how to bring a Swing <CODE>JComponent</CODE> into the zio
system. <P>Note that this example was written before the zio package had a text
area or a button object. It is no longer necessary to import Swing
objects to use such things with zio. The example is still useful because
it shows you how to bring almost any Swing <CODE>JComponent</CODE> into the zio
package. Also, since it involves kinds of objects that exist both within
Swing and zio, you can use it to compare Swing's way of doing things
with zio's.<P>Here is code that creates a <CODE>JTextArea</CODE> object, puts that object into
a <CODE>JScrollPane</CODE> (so that it will have scrollbars when needed), and
puts that <CODE>JScrollPane</CODE> into a <CODE>ZComponent</CODE>.  Roughly speaking, what is
happening is that we are converting a <CODE>JTextArea</CODE> into a <CODE>ZObject</CODE>.<P><CODE>JTextArea&nbsp;text&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;JTextArea();<BR>ZComponent&nbsp;textComponent&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZComponent(&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;JScrollPane(&nbsp;text&nbsp;)<BR>).expandH().expandV().size(&nbsp;new&nbsp;Dimension(300,250)&nbsp;);<BR>
</CODE><P>The newly created <CODE>ZComponent</CODE> is modified with suffixes that
override Swing's notion of its size and override zio's default rigid
size so that the underlying text area can expand in both horizontal and
vertical directions.<P>Before converting a <CODE>JButton</CODE> into a <CODE>ZObject</CODE>, we will create an
an easier-to-use subclass.  Our style involves creating a separate subclass
for each button we need.  Here is the subclass for a print button.<P><CODE>private&nbsp;static&nbsp;class&nbsp;PrintButton&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extends&nbsp;JButton&nbsp;implements&nbsp;ActionListener&nbsp;{<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private&nbsp;JTextArea&nbsp;text;<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;PrintButton(JTextArea&nbsp;text)&nbsp;{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super("print&nbsp;the&nbsp;text");<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.text&nbsp;=&nbsp;text;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addActionListener(this);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;void&nbsp;actionPerformed(ActionEvent&nbsp;ignore)&nbsp;{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(text.getText());<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<BR><BR>}<BR><BR>
</CODE><P>There are Swing details here that go beyond our current scope. In
English, this class defines a kind of button which responds to a
mouse click by printing the contents of a <CODE>JTextarea</CODE>
on the command window.  <P>The constructor creates the button, makes
not of which <CODE>JTextarea</CODE> is involved, and arranges for Swing
to call the <CODE>actionPerformed</CODE> method when the mouse's left
button is clicked.  <P>The <CODE>actionPerformed</CODE> method fetches the contents of the
<CODE>JTextArea</CODE> and prints it on the command window. Creating a
separate button class for every button allows us to ignore
the <CODE>ActionEvent</CODE> parameter that is passed to <CODE>actionPerformed</CODE>
by the Swing system when a button is clicked.  Following a style
of object-oriented design advocated by Bertrand Meyer, it also
allows us to
unnecessary branching in our <CODE>actionPerformed</CODE> method.<P>Converting a <CODE>PrintButton</CODE> to a <CODE>ZObject</CODE> is easy<P><CODE>ZComponent&nbsp;show&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZComponent(&nbsp;new&nbsp;PrintButton(text)&nbsp;);<BR>
</CODE><P>The other button needed by this example can be created in the
same way.  <P><B>Two Dimensional Expansion of a Slice</B><P>You may have noticed that the <CODE>textComponent</CODE> object created
above expands in two directions but is to be placed into a <CODE>ZCol</CODE>
that normally expands only one direction.  Suppose the placement 
is done this way<P><CODE>new&nbsp;ZCol(&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border(8,Color.BLUE),&nbsp;text,&nbsp;border(8,Color.BLUE)<BR>);<BR>
</CODE><P>This approach would create a fixed-width column. Even though all
objects in the column can expand horizontally, they would not be
permitted to do so. Well not much, the smaller ones would be
permitted to expand to the width of the largest one.  Beyond that,
there would be no horizontal expansions.  <CODE>ZCol</CODE>s do not do
that unless you force them to.<P>To make a column capable of expanding horizontally, what is needed is
an additional suffix, <CODE>unlock()</CODE>. This suffix <I>permits</I> a slice
to expand in the direction it normally would not. It does not force a
slice to expand that direction.  Expansion may happen only when the
slice contains a <CODE>ZObject</CODE> that can do the expanding.  That, of course,
is exactly the case for the right hand column of the text entry example.<P>Here is the code that creates a text entry <CODE>ZWindow</CODE> and populates
it with the appropriate layout of <CODE>ZObject</CODE>s.<P><CODE>ZWindow&nbsp;w&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZWindow(<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Text&nbsp;Entry",<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZRow(&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZCol(&nbsp;show,&nbsp;clear&nbsp;),<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;ZCol(&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border(8,Color.BLUE),&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;textComponent,&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border(8,Color.BLUE)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).unlock()<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).unlock()<BR>);<BR>
</CODE><P>Notice that both the right hand column and the outer row are unlocked.  <P><B>The Rest of the Story:</B><P>A later version of the zio package will make it easy to make a set of
buttons (or almost anything else) the same size.  For now, it is a 
bit of a hassle.  What I did for this example was to run the program
without paying attention to button size but using a <CODE>debug</CODE> suffix
on each <CODE>ZComponent</CODE> containing a button.  Then I knew the size
I wanted and used the <CODE>size</CODE> suffix to get it.<P>You are now ready to see the complete code for the text entry example
and think about how the zio package might be useful in your own work.
Find the code <A HREF="ProgrammerExamples/FourthExample.java">here</A>.<P>I think the example demonstrates the simplicity of this way to do layout but
I should mention a major limitation:  the system only works on windows whose
objects are not replaced during execution.  I have ideas about how to overcome
that limitation but may never get around to implementing them. If you have any
ideas let me know.  I do confess though that I will find your ideas a lot more
interesting if you are willing to do most of the work to see that they are
implemented.<P>A final word about my purpose in creating this package. My goals were
three: to have some classes useful in teaching, to have some classes
that I myself would like to work with, and to simplify the work of
making simple GUI's in Java. This mixture of goals shows in the
<CODE>Textarea.java</CODE> example. You do not see <CODE>System.out.println</CODE>
there. Instead you see <CODE>Zio.show()</CODE>. I did it that way simply so I
could tie necessary beginner things up in a neat package.<P>Although accessibility for beginners is still a primary motivation, I believe
the zio package has
developed to the point where it will be useful for many professional programmers
whose work accepts the package's limitations.  I tend to build rather
robust software.  Let me know of any bugs and I will get on to them as soon as
possible.  You can reach me at
mmmyy@jazimmer.net where mmm is the current month in the form,  jan,feb,mar,...,
and yy is the last two digits of the year.<P>I have released the zio package and its documentation under the
