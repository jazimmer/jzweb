<I>objects</I> first. My early efforts made use of existing resources:
<A HREF="http://www.beanshell.org">Beanshell</A> for algorithms first and
<A HREF="http://www.BlueJ.org">BlueJ</A> for objects first. I wasn't very
satisfied with either one and started building my own tools. My goals
were three: to have some classes useful in teaching, to have some
classes that I myself would like to work with, and to simplify the work
of making simple GUI's in Java. I may have succeeded.<P>The zio package described in these pages will support algorithms first
or objects first teaching of an introductory Java course.<P><OL>
<P>
<LI> <I>Start the class algorithmically</I> and  teach a somewhat traditional
course that slowly introduces objects.  <P>There are books out there to help
you with this.  What is difficult though, is getting through Java's
I/O barrier.  The zio package provides for 
<A HREF="zioIO.html">both file and console I/O</A>.<P>
<LI> <I>Start the class with objects.</I>  
Use the <A HREF="zioDialog.html">zio dialog</A> approach with the help of
the <CODE>DialogWindow</CODE> and <CODE>DisplayWindow</CODE> classes.<P>With this approach classes, objects, methods, and inheritance are
emphasized early on.  By the end of the course they have been
massively reinforced.  File I/O can be limited to whole files
which is one of the options discussed in the &#8220;file I/O&#8221 reference
above.<P> 
</OL><P>The zio package is a less ambitious variation of a 
<A HREF="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts//jtf/rationale/index.html">proposal</A>
by the ACM Java Task force.
<A HREF="acmGraphics.html">Here</A> is a comparison of the two.<P>I have used
early versions of zio both ways. I intend to go the objects first way in
the fall of 2005. If you want to discuss it with me or, better yet, to
work with me to refine my way of doing it, then contact me at
mmmyy@jazimmer.org where where the <CODE>mmm</CODE> is one of jan, feb, mar, ...
and the <CODE>yy</CODE> is the last two digits of the year. <P><PRE></PRE><P><TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD ALIGN="left" WIDTH="15%"><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="../zio.html">context</A></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="center" WIDTH="40%"><FONT SIZE="-1">Jul 19, 2005</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="right" WIDTH="15%"><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="http://jazimmer.net/">author</A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
