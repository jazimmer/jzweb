This past year, I emphasized GUI programming from day one.  Our programs
generated a kind of interactive window with a line of text that the
program controlled and a line that the user controlled.  I called the
class which generated these things a <CODE>DialogBox</CODE> class.<P>A <CODE>DialogBox</CODE> object
 shows a window with a line of displayed text and a
data entry line.  The class has a <CODE>processInput()</CODE> method that is executed 
whenever the user enters input and a <CODE>writeString()</CODE> method that rewrites
the displayed text.<P>My approach was "objects first"&#151;something I had on my mind from
having tried BlueJ the year earlier.  Only my objects were all instances
of subclasses of one class.  Students used the <CODE>DialogBox</CODE> class by
overriding the <CODE>processInput()</CODE> method in a subclass. For example,<P><CODE>public&nbsp;void&nbsp;processInput(&nbsp;String&nbsp;userin&nbsp;)&nbsp;{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writeString(userin);<BR>}<BR><BR>
</CODE><P>defines a <CODE>processInput()</CODE> that will simply echo back what the user types.<P>Other fairly simple examples illustrate instance variables.  A chat
example showed how two objects become aware of each other.<P>Although this approach emphasized objects early on, I did not go into
lots of detail about how things work.  At first I told students that
"The <CODE>DialogBox</CODE> class is a complete GUI program with one thing missing:
the way it responds to user input. You have to add that missing piece.
Do it by making another class which is just like <CODE>DialogBox</CODE> but for
a new version of the <CODE>processInput()</CODE> method."<P>THE zio PACKAGE DOES NOT YET SUPPORT <CODE>DialogBox</CODE>.  It will REAL SOON NOW.<P>My old version of <CODE>DialogBox</CODE> was a dead end.  I had no good way to teach
students how to make their own <CODE>DialogBox</CODE> classes.  A major reason for
creating the GUI part of the zio package is to overcome that limitation.<P>More about the zio package
