I/O as was done, for example, in the days of Pascal or C and to do
so in a way that uses the same methods for user interaction as for
file I/O.<P>Use the <CODE>Input</CODE> class for reading from the keyboard (via
the command window) or from
a text file and use the <CODE>Output</CODE> class for writing to the command window
or to a text file.<P>Methods in these classes are not overloaded so students must
keep track of which data types they are working with.  This seems a
bit heavy but it is good practice for the kinds of things a student  needs
to keep straight when taking the AP exam.<P>The <CODE>Input</CODE> class provides a unified way of reading from lots of
sources and the <CODE>Output</CODE> class provides a unified way of writing to
lots of destinations.  More advanced students can use these classes
for socket I/O
or to replace the 
(now deprecated) 
<CODE>StringTokenizer</CODE> class.  The main limitation is that these classes
work only with text, not images or sound.<P>The <CODE>Input</CODE> and <CODE>Output</CODE> classes are freely available
