You need to have a Java development system (JDK version 1.4 or later) 
installed first. <P><B>For the first method:</B> <P>This is the recommended way to do it.
If you
search through the folders used by your Java development system you will
find at least one named <CODE>ext</CODE>. It may be easier to find these folders
if you know that <CODE>ext</CODE> is included in another folder named <CODE>lib</CODE>. Not
all <CODE>lib</CODE> folders contain an <CODE>ext</CODE> folder. The ones that do are
of interest here.<P>One gotcha to watch out for is that many computers have had a Java
virtual machine for web browser use installed before they had a Java
development system installed. You may have to find the <CODE>ext</CODE> in this
run-time system as well as any that came with the development system.
(On the computer I am using at the moment, I found three <CODE>lib/ext</CODE>
folder combinations to copy <CODE>zio.jar</CODE> into.)<P><B>For the second method:</B><P>Unzip these files into a directory (folder) named <CODE>zio</CODE>. To get the
package mechanism working correctly this <CODE>zio</CODE> must be placed within
a directory on the class path. Moreover, when you compile the zio
classes you must do so from that containing directory.<P>You may or may not be need to alter the CLASSPATH environment variable.
If you need to, you may or may not be able to.  
<A HREF="studentworkaround.html">Here</A> is one work around that uses batch/shell
files for compiling and executing Java programs.<P><B>With either method:</B><P>You can make use of the zio classes in your Java code by placing this
statement at the beginning<P><CODE>import&nbsp;zio.*;<BR>
