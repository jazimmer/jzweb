<H2>Listen to your body, your mind, and your soul</H2>

   Almost all of us believe, or would like to believe, that
we are more than the sum of our parts.  Call that additional
thing your soul and you have three aspects: your body, your
mind, and your soul.  It's a shame to neglect any of them.
It's a shame to try to remake any one of them into what it
cannot be.  Try to stay aware of all of you.
<P>
   Of our three aspects, it is the soul we most neglect in our
modern world.  Don't.  Reach out to your soul with religion,
music, art, and meditation in whatever combination suits you
best.  Strangely, even if you don't quite believe it is there,
you will find that you can reach out to your soul.
