<H2> Be neither an island nor a swamp </H2>
<P>
   An island is someone who is not accessible to other people.  
A swamp is someone who, having established a meaningful 
relationship with others, tries to suck them in so deep that 
they cannot see any daylight outside the relationship.
<P>
   In a way, this goal says don't drop out from the human race
or make the mistake of thinking that the center of the human
race coincides with your own navel.  But it goes beyond that.
If you are not an island, you will feel others' pain and
consequently help them when you can.  If you are not a 
swamp, you will not expect them to be eternally grateful 
for that help.
