<h1 class="spaced1">Sizing Sets</h1>

Are these two sets the same size?  

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/sameSizeQuestion.png" alt="image: The Same Size?"/></div>

One way to answer this is to say “No, because the one on
the left has three elements and the one on the right has
four.”

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
But when you try to count some sets, the counting never ends.
We call those sets <span class="italicjz">infinite</span>.  <span class="italicjz">Finite</span> sets of course
are those that can be counted in finite
time.  To know a set is finite we must be able to
show that 
counting will come to an end&mdash;although perhaps not in our
lifetimes.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> In this chapter we will look at a
way to do endless counting.  Later on we will consider the
possibility that even endless counting is not enough to size
some sets.  But first
we need examples of infinite sets to work with.  Our number
system provides plenty of examples.

<h2 class="first">Numbers Again</h2>

The real numbers <span class="boldjz code">R</span> and two of its subsets, <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> (the
integers) and <span class="boldjz code">N</span> (the natural numbers), are good subjects
talking about things infinite because we have a lot of common
understanding about their properties.  In the previous topic
we worked with intervals of real numbers.  Here we will work
with intervals of integers as well.  To
distinguish between different kinds of intervals we will use the following
notation.

<ul><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">[x,y]</sup></span>
represents all the numbers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> including both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> 
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are numbers with
<span class="code">x≤y</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[x,y]</sup></span>
represents all the integers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> including both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> 
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are integers with
<span class="code">x≤y</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(x,y)</sup></span> represents all the numbers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> excluding both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are numbers with
<span class="code">n&lt;m</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">(x,y)</sup></span> represents all the integers between <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> excluding both <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>
(<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are integers with
<span class="code">x&lt;y</span>) 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(x,∞)</sup></span>
represents the set of all numbers greater than <span class="code">x</span> (<span class="code">x</span>
is any number)  
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">(x,∞)</sup></span> 
represents the set of all integers greater than <span class="code">x</span> (<span class="code">x</span>
is any integer)  
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(-∞,y)</sup></span> 
represents the set of all numbers less than <span class="code">y</span>
(<span class="code">y</span> is any number). 
</li><li>
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">(-∞,y)</sup></span> 
represents the set of all integers less than <span class="code">y</span> (<span class="code">y</span> is
any integer).
</li></ul>

This notation makes it seem like ∞ is a number but it is
just a symbol we call “infinity”.  With
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(x,∞)</sup></span> it means that
no finite number we might put in its place will be big enough
to describe the entire interval and with
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(-∞,y)</sup></span> it means that no finite number we
might put in its place will be small enough to describe the
entire interval.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Extrapolating a bit from this notation can you find simple
ways of representing these intervals <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,∞)</sup></span> and
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(-∞,∞)</sup></span><span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer:</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,∞)</sup></span><span class="code">=<span class="boldjz">N</span></span> and
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(-∞,∞)</sup></span><span class="code">=<span class="boldjz">R</span></span>.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
By the end of this topic we will understand how
<span class="boldjz code">R<sup class="smalljz">(0,1)</sup></span> is bigger than <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> and the same size as
<span class="boldjz code">R</span>.

<h2 class="next">Counting</h2>

Imagine you are counting apples in a basket.  One way to do it
is to put labels, <span class="code">1,2,3,…,n</span>, on them.  When the last
label is <span class="code">n</span>, that is the size of the set of apples in
that basket.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
This being a book about mathematics, our labels will be
elements of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and, instead of pasting labels on
set elements, we will match  elements of <span class="boldjz code">N</span>
in a one-to-one way with the apples or whatever in the set to
be counted.  Of course the count starts with the label
1, and continues with 2, then 3, and so on. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Here is a representation of the kind of matching we use when
determining the size of a set through counting.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/Count1.png" alt="image: Counting a set of size 4"/></div>

The little squares represent unknown, but distinct, elements.
The lines link these elements to numbers in <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,4]</sup></span>.  Four
numbers in <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,4]</sup></span> demonstrate there are four
elements in <span class="code">S</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Lines are a good way to show links but sometimes they are
too imprecise.  For more precision we define a <span class="italicjz">link</span>
between a set <span class="code">A</span> and a set <span class="code">B</span> as a two-element set
with one element from <span class="code">A</span> and the other from <span class="code">B</span>. Each
of these elements is an <span class="italicjz">end</span> of the link.  A link between
<span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is the same as a link between <span class="code">B</span> and
<span class="code">A</span> because two element sets {<span class="code">x,y</span>} and {<span class="code">y,x</span>} are
the same set.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> For infinite sets, the counting process does not end.  In this diagram

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/Count3.png" alt="image: Counting an infinite set"/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> These diagrams represent two ways of counting real
numbers.  Both countings go on forever and neither covers all
the real numbers.  <div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display"> We need to think of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and
<span class="boldjz code">R</span> as two distinct sets to make this work.  Otherwise the
link between 1 in <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and 1 in <span class="boldjz code">R</span> would be a one
element set (not a two element set with one element in <span class="boldjz code">N</span>
and the other in <span class="boldjz code">R</span> as required).  However since all we
are doing is finding a way to count elements it is ok to think
of <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and <span class="boldjz code">R</span> as different copies of themselves.  </div>

Do these examples indicate that
there are more real numbers than natural numbers<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer:</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
No.  All these diagrams show is that neither of two different ways of matching
natural numbers  with real numbers covers all the real
numbers.  To show that no matching with <span class="boldjz code">N</span> can cover all
the elements of <span class="boldjz code">R</span> requires a clever argument.  Proving a
negative tends to be difficult.
</div>


<h2 class="next">Matchings</h2>  

Our basic tool for investigating the relative sizes of sets is
the matching.  Here are some relevant definitions.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> A set of links between a set <span class="code">A</span> and another set <span class="code">B</span>
is called a <span class="italicjz">relation</span>.  Since the link {<span class="code">a,b</span>} is the same as 
the link {<span class="code">b,a</span>}, relations are symmetric, i.e. a relation
between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is also a relation between <span class="code">B</span>
and <span class="code">A</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> A relation <span class="code">R</span>
<ul><li>
<span class="italicjz">covers</span> <span class="code">A</span>  in case every element of <span class="code">A</span> 
is included in some link of <span class="code">R</span>.
</li><li>
<span class="italicjz">separates</span> <span class="code">A</span>  in case every element of <span class="code">A</span>  
is included in no more than one link of <span class="code">R</span>.
</li></ul>

Because of symmetry you can swap
<span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> in these definitions and understand how they
apply to <span class="code">B</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Visually <span class="code">R</span> separates both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> when there no
pair of links looks like either of these.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="45px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/lines1.png" alt="image:  Intersecting Lines"/></div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
A relation 
is a <span class="italicjz">matching</span> in case it separates both
<span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> A matching is <span class="italicjz">complete</span> in case it covers
both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>.
</li></ul>

Here is an example of a set of links that is not even close to
being a matching

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="155px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/matching1.png" alt="image: Not a matching"/></div>

because neither <span class="code">A</span> or <span class="code">B</span> is separated nor completely
covered.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Here is a property of matchings we will need in later
chapters.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
<span class="boldjz">P7.1</span> 
<div  class="indent display">
Any subset <span class="code">M'</span> of a matching <span class="code">M</span> between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>
is a matching between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>.
</div>
<span class="boldjz">Proof</span>
<div  class="indent display">
Since <span class="code">M'</span> is clearly a relation, all we need to know is that <span class="code">M'</span> separates both <span class="code">A</span> and
<span class="code">B</span>, i.e. no two links in <span class="code">M'</span> have an
end in common.  
They will not because if they did then there
would be two links in <span class="code">M</span> that have an end in common.
</div><div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>

There is a subtlety here worth thinking about.
The empty set ∅ is a subset of <span class="code">M</span> and so P7.1
says it is a matching.  This is ok because the condition that
makes a relation a matching 
only talks about links in the
relation.  When there are no links, there is no condition to
satisfy.  The definition of a matching excludes relations whose links share an element
and accepts all other relations.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="boldjz">P7.2</span>
<div  class="indent display">
A relation <span class="code">R</span> between <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is a complete matching exactly
when every element of <span class="code">A<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0.2em;vertical-align:10%; font-size:75%;">⋃</span>B</span> is in exactly one link of
<span class="code">R</span>.
</div>

<span class="boldjz">Proof</span>
<div  class="indent display">
All that is needed for this proof is to put the definitions of
<span class="code">separates</span> and <span class="code">covers</span> together.
</div>
<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Let's return to thinking about the empty set because that can
be tricky.  Here is a question to
practice on: can you say what has to be true for
the empty set to be a complete matching<span class="boldjz code">?</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div> <h4>answer</h4> <div  class="indent display"> Since ∅ is always a
matching, P7.2 tells us that all we need is for every element of <span class="code">A<span style="padding-left:0.2em;padding-right:0.2em;vertical-align:10%; font-size:75%;">⋃</span>B</span>
to be in exactly one link.  So if either <span class="code">A</span> or <span class="code">B</span> has
any elements, the empty set, having no links at all, cannot be a complete matching
between them.  But if both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are empty then
the empty set is a complete matching because all the elements
in <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are in exactly one link of ∅.
</div>


<h2 class="next">A Theory of Set Sizes</h2>

The theory of set sizes we learned in elementary school has us
counting the elements in a finite set until the counting stops
with a number <span class="code">n</span>.  This number is called the
<span class="italicjz">cardinality</span> of the set and, at least for a finite set
<span class="code">S</span>,  it is denoted
<span class="code">|S|</span>.  

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
The <span class="code">|x|</span> notation has multiple meanings.  It means absolute value when <span class="code">x</span> is a
number and cardinality when <span class="code">x</span> is a set.
</div>


In this topic the concept of a complete matching replaces the
concept of cardinality.  We don't count elements of sets,
unless they are finite.  Instead we say two sets <span class="code">A</span>
and <span class="code">B</span> are <span class="italicjz">size-equal</span> in case there is a complete
matching between them.  So when <span class="code">S</span> is finite, it is
size-equal with <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,|S|]</sup></span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> We say a set <span class="code">S</span> is <span class="italicjz">countable</span> in case <span class="code">S</span> is finite and has a complete matching
with <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,|S|]</sup></span> or is infinite and has a complete
matching with <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,∞)</sup></span>.  Countable sets always
have a complete matching with a subset of <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="190px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/Count2.png" alt="image: file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/Count2.png"/></div>
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Sets for which no matching with a subset of the natural
numbers exists are said to be
<span class="italicjz">uncountable</span>.  We will prove some sets uncountable after
we have developed and sanity checked our theory for comparing
the sizes of sets.


<h2 class="next">Countable Sets</h2>

Before continuing with our general theory let's look at what
<span class="code">size-equal</span> tells us about the sizes of infinite sets.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
It is obvious that the set of negative integers
<span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">(-∞,-1]</sup></span> is size-equal to the set of
positive integers <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">[1,∞)</sup></span>.  But what happens if we add a
few elements?  The following diagram shows that <span class="boldjz code">Z<sup class="smalljz">(-∞,-1]</sup></span>
doesn't become any larger when 0,1, and 2 are added.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="220px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/comparing2.png" alt="image: Adding a Few Integers"/></div>

This is rather weird and even more weird is that
removing infinitely many integers from a countable set of
integers doesn't necessarily change the size.  Consider this
complete matching.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="190px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/comparing3.png" alt="image: Odd Positive Integers Are Countable"/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Are you beginning to see how this works? Can you show that <span class="boldjz code">N</span> is the same size
as the set of positive integers that are divisible by
10<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="190px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/comparing6.png" alt="image: N Compared with 10,20,30,..."/></div>
<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 class="next">Counting With Arrows</h2>

Although complete matchings are important for our theory of
sizing sets, there is an easier way to show a set is
 countably infinite than by creating a complete matching with
<span class="boldjz code">N</span>. 
The complete matching between <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and the odd
integers seen in the last section could have been established
this way

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="80px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/comparing7.png" alt="image: Positive Odd Integers are Countable"/></div>

Here the first arrow counts 1, the second 2, the third 3, and
so forth.  This style of counting corresponds easily with
matchings as shown in this diagram.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="180px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/comparing4.png" alt="image: How Arrows Count"/></div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Let's look at a couple examples in which it is easier to count with
arrows than to establish a complete matching with <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.
These examples show that sets that we would normally think are
much, much larger than <span class="boldjz code">N</span> are countable.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
To start with let's count <span class="boldjz code">Z</span>, the set of all integers
using arrows.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="140px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/countableInts.png" alt="image: Z is countable"/></div>

Thus <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> which seems to be at least twice as large as
<span class="boldjz code">N</span> is size-equal with <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.  

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
This is pretty obvious but
for an actual proof, look ahead to P8.4 which explains how two
   complete matchings, say between a set <span class="code">S</span> and  <span class="boldjz code">N</span>  and
   between <span class="boldjz code">N</span> and  another set <span class="code">S'</span>, can be combined into another 
   complete matching between <span class="code">S</span> and <span class="code">S'</span>.
   </div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Can we include significantly more numbers and still have a
set that is  size-equal to <span class="boldjz code">N</span>?  Let's look at the rational
numbers. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The rational numbers are those numbers which can be
expressed as a fraction with an integer in both the numerator
and the denominator.  
Are the rationals also countable? We can answer that in the
affirmative with arrows, but first
we need a way of representing all of the
rationals in
a diagram.  This will do the trick.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="215px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/rationals1.png" alt="image: Charting the Rationals"/></div>

This pattern includes all the rationals and more.
In fact each fraction appears infinitely many times, 
for example, 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1/1, 2/2, 3/3, …
</div>

are all the same rational number.  If our arrows skip over
duplicates,  we can
use arrows to count the rationals as in this diagram.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="320px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/rationals3.png" alt="image: Counting the Rationals"/></div>

You can see the arrows will count all the rationals and only
the rationals.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So the rational numbers are also countable!

<h2 class="next">The Mystery of Proper Subsets</h2>

So <span class="boldjz code">N</span> is a subset of the set of <span class="boldjz code">Z</span>
that seems to be much smaller because 
there are infinitely many integers of <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> that are not
included in <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.  Yet the two sets are
size-equal.  This requires some explanation.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> 
An explanation has to do with the difference between comparing the sizes
of two sets and comparing a set with a subset.  The former 
generalizes counting to complete matchings and the later 
generalizes the concept of subset with that of proper subset.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
There is a difference between counting that comes
to an end and counting that does not.
When we count the elements of a set and the counting comes to
an end, we will have already counted the elements of any
subset.  This is what happens with finite sets.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
However if both a set and a subset of that set are infinite,
counting will never finish either one of them.  This
diagram shows such a case.

Both <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> and <span class="boldjz code">N</span> are counted.  From 1 forward, every
two arrows of counting <span class="boldjz code">Z</span> becomes one arrow in counting
<span class="boldjz code">N</span>.  Both sets are infinitely countable which means both
can have complete matchings with an additional copy of <span class="boldjz code">N</span>.

The basic ideas behind the theory for comparing set sizes
presented here were established by 
German mathematician, Georg Cantor, who was active in the
last part of the 19th century.  However
Cantor's imagination took him further than we will go.  He
defined the concept of a cardinal number that expresses the
size of a set, finite or infinite.  Because numbers don't make
much sense without arithmetic, Cantor defined a kind of
transfinite arithmetic that is consistent with the arithmetic
we know.  
<br/><br/>
Here we use
Cantor's ideas without bothering with cardinal numbers or
transfinite arithmetic.  A theorem attributed to Ernst Schröder and
Felix Bernstein helps make this possible.
