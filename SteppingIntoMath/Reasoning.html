<h1 class="spaced1">Mathematical Reasoning</h1>

Although mathematicians are experimenting with other forms of
logic, mathematics itself is based on the belief that
statements must be true or false but <span class="code">not</span> both.  A
statement that is both true and false is a paradox.  Paradoxes and
mathematical reasoning do not get along with each other.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So around the beginning 
of the 20th century, mathematicians created rules that remove
the possibility of paradoxes getting into mathematics.  You
saw an important one of these rules in the first chapter: a set may not
directly or indirectly contain itself.  The principle extends
to more than sets.  A statement like this

<div  class="indent display">
“This sentence is false.”
</div>

is forbidden.  If you think about it, you will know it is
paradoxical, but it is forbidden because it references itself.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Continuing with the same kind of thinking, a mathematical
proof that a statement <span class="code">A</span> is true or false may not directly or
indirectly rely on the truth of <span class="code">A</span>.  However there is a
way it can <span class="italicjz">assume</span> the falsity of <span class="code">A</span>.

<h2 class="first">Proof by Contradiction</h2>

A proof by contradiction goes like this: To prove <span class="code">A</span> use the 
possibility that <span class="code">¬A</span> is true as your starting point. 
If reasoning from that starting point leads to a paradox, then we know <span class="code">not A</span> is false and
so <span class="code">A</span> must be true.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
By “leads to a paradox” is meant it is possible to prove
something is false that is known to be true or something is
true that is known to be false. In other words you are
contradicting something you already know.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Of course if the theory we are building already contains a
paradox, a proof by contradiction doesn't work very well.  However
that difficulty is not an argument against proofs by
contradiction because if our theory  already contains a paradox
it was ruined before we began our proof by contradiction.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> A common example of a proof by contradiction is a proof
that there are infinitely many prime numbers. 

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
A prime number is a positive
integer that is divisible only by itself or 1.
</div>

To prove this, how would you begin a proof by contradiction<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
Assume that there are only
finitely many prime numbers.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
If there are only finitely many prime numbers, we can list them in a
sequence like this 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
p<sub class="smalljz">1</sub>,p<sub class="smalljz">2</sub>,p<sub class="smalljz">3</sub>,…,p<sub class="smalljz">n</sub>
</div>

Then let
<div  class="code_block indent display">
Xp = p<sub class="smalljz">1</sub>&times;p<sub class="smalljz">2</sub>&times;p<sub class="smalljz">3</sub>&times;…&times;p<sub class="smalljz">n</sub>
</div>

Now consider <span class="code">Xp+1</span> which, like any integer greater than
one, is either prime or divisible by a prime.  Either
possibility
leads to a contradiction:

<ol><li>
If <span class="code">Xp+1</span> is prime then it is larger than all the
<span class="code">p<sub class="smalljz">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> and its existence contradicts our
assumption that it is possible to list all the primes in a
finite sequence.
</li><li>
If <span class="code">Xp</span> is not prime then it is divisible by a prime
<span class="code">p</span>.  Our assumption says <span class="code">p</span> is one of the
<span class="code">p<sub class="smalljz">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> and so <span class="code">p</span> also divides <span class="code">Xp</span>.
Because <span class="code">p</span> divides both <span class="code">Xp</span> and <span class="code">Xp+1</span> there are
numbers <span class="code">n</span> and <span class="code">m</span> such that <span class="code">n&times;p=Xp</span> and
<span class="code">m&times;p=Xp+1</span>.
<br/><br/>
Now <span class="code">Xp+1-Xp=1</span> and so substitituting for <span class="code">Xp</span> and
<span class="code">Xp+1</span>,

<div  class="code_block indent display">/
m&times;p - n&times;p = 1
</div>

or

<div  class="code_block indent display">
m - n = 1/p
</div>

which is impossible because <span class="code">m</span> and <span class="code">n</span>
are integers and <span class="code">1/p</span> is not (because <span class="code">p</span> is a prime
and primes are natural numbers greater than 1).
</li></ol>

Therefore our assumption leads to a contradiction and so the number of prime numbers cannot be finite.

<h2 class="next">Mathematical Induction</h2>

Here is a sequence of assertions

<div  class="code_block indent display">
A<sub class="smalljz">1</sub>, A<sub class="smalljz">2</sub>, A<sub class="smalljz">3</sub>, …
</div>

There is not much information here, only that we have
infinitely many assertions each with its own natural number
subscript.  But if the <span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> 
make the same claim about ever
more complicated data then mathematical induction may provide
a technique for proving them all true.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Here is the proof process used by this technique.

<ol><li>
Prove <span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">1</sub></span>.  <span class="italicjz">(the
base case)</span>
</li><li>
Prove an arbitrary <span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">i</sub></span> (with
<span class="code">i&gt;1</span>), assuming it is known that the
<span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">j</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> that came before are true.  <span class="italicjz">(the inductive step)</span>
</li></ol>

I think of this as a proving machine: once the base case
<span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">1</sub></span> is
known to be true, the machine starts its work by proving
<span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">1</sub></span>, then <span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">2</sub></span>, and so on.  Of course the machine never
finishes its job, but no matter what <span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">i</sub></span> you are
interested in, the machine will get around to proving it in
finite time. 

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
What makes this different from simply picking an arbitrary
<span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">i</sub></span> (with <span class="code">i&gt;1</span>) and proving it is true, is that
 the proof of <span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">i</sub></span> depends on knowing <span class="code">A<sub class="smalljz">j</sub></span> is true for
 <span class="code">1≤j&lt;i</span>.
</div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
As an example let's prove that 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(n&times;(n+1))/2 = 1+2+3+…+n
</div>

for all <span class="code">n∊<span class="boldjz code">N</span></span>.

We start with the base case, which requires us to show that
<span class="code">(1&times;(1+1))/2</span> is equal to the a sum that adds up the
numbers in {<span class="code">1</span>}.  This is certainly true because the
formula evaluates to 1, and the sum is also 1.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
For the inductive step we need to prove that

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(i&times;(i+1))/2 = 1+2+3…+i
</div>

for any <span class="code">i&gt;1</span> under the assumption
   that 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(j&times;(j+1))/2 = 1+2+3+…+j
</div>

for any positive integer <span class="code">j</span> that is less than <span class="code">i</span>.
This bit of knowledge is called the <span class="italicjz">induction hypothesis</span>
and for this proof it tells us that 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1+2+3+…+i = i + ((i-1)&times;(i-1+1)) / 2

Therefore

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1+2+3+…+i = i + ((i-1)&times;(i-1+1)) / 2
          = 2&times;i/2 + ((i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (2&times;i+(i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = ((2+i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (i&times;(i+1))  / 2
</div>
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
I like to incorporate the concept of induction with a
technique that appears to be something like 
a proof by
contradiction.  On this example this approach begins by
letting <span class="code">Nope</span> be the
set of all <span class="code">i</span> such that

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(i&times;(i+1))/2 ≠ 1+2+3…+i
</div>

The desired result is true exactly when <span class="code">Nope=∅</span>.
A proof by contradiction begins by assuming <span class="code">Nope</span> 
is not empty.  Under that assumption we can pick a smallest <span class="code">i∊Nope</span>.
To prove <span class="code">i</span> cannot exist we need to consider two cases.
What are they<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
Either <span class="code">i=1</span> or <span class="code">i&gt;1</span>.  This is the same division
into cases we needed with a standard induction.  The base case
considered <span class="code">i=1</span> and the induction hypothesis said the
result was true for every <span class="code">j&lt;i</span> where <span class="code">i</span> was any
natural number greater than 1.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
So the proof goes like this.
<ol><li>
This <span class="code">i</span> cannot be 1 because

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(1&times;(1+1))/2 = 1 
</div>
</li><li>

This <span class="code">i</span> cannot be greater than 1 because if it is then
<span class="code">i-1<span style='font-size:70%'>∉</span>Nope</span> and so

<div  class="code_block indent display">
( (i-1)&times;i) ) = 1+2+3+…+(i-1)
</div>

This means

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1+2+3+…+i = i + ((i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = 2&times;i/2 + ((i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (2&times;i+(i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = ((2+i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (i&times;(i+1))  / 2
</div>

showing that <span class="code">Nope</span> cannot contain a least integer which of
course means <span class="code">Nope=</span>∅ and so
the result is true.
</li></ul>


<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Mathematical induction apparently first appeared in the 19th
century.  Of course there were other techniques before that.
Here is a picture proof of the formula for adding the first
<span class="code">n</span> numbers that appeared in ancient times 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/SumWithout.png" alt="image: Summation Image Without any Variables"/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Variables were introduced in Europe at the end of the 17th
century. Here is the same proof with some annotating
variables.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="180px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/SumWith.png" alt="image: Summation Image With Variable N"/></div>

Now you can see the area of the rectangle is <span class="code">n&times;(n+1)</span>
and the shaded part is both half the total area and 
the result of adding <span class="code">1+2+3+…+n</span>.

<h2 class="next">Propositional Logic</h2>

Metamathematics is the use of mathematics to investigate
mathematics.  Exactly which parts of mathematics you can use
in metamathematics depends on which aspect of
mathematics you are studying. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The Propositional Logic is a bit of mathematics that also
qualifies as metamathematics.  We can use it to make new
inference rules for mathematics.  The language of the
Propositional Logic consists 
of atomic statements and compound statements.
All statements can be referenced with variable names
that begin with a capital letter and represent an assertion
that something is true or false.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Atomic statements may be created by fiat, i.e.

<div  class="indent display">
let <span class="code">R</span> be the statement, “It will rain today.”
<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
let <span class="code">S</span> be the statement, “Every natural number
is prime.”
</div>

When atomic statements are created  they are given a value of
true (T) or false (F).  This value does not come from the
Propositional Logic, it is given to the Propositional Logic
having been determined in some other way.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Compound statements are built up from other statements
(from both atomic statements and
compound statements).  One way to do this
is to negate a statement.  So if <span class="code">A</span> is T then ¬<span class="code">A</span>
(aka not <span class="code">A</span>)
is F and if <span class="code">A</span> is F then ¬<span class="code">A</span> is T.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The other way to create a compound statement is
to use one of the following three constructions:

<ul><li>
<span class="smalljz">Build <span class="code">A∧B</span> from <span class="code">A</span>
and <span class="code">B</span> -- <span class="italicjz">think “and”</span></span>
</li><li>
<span class="smalljz">Build <span class="code">A∨B</span> from <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> -- <span class="italicjz">think “or”.</span> </span>
</li><li>
<span class="smalljz">Build <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> from <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> -- <span class="italicjz">think “implies”.</span> </span>
</li></ul>

Here is a compound statement:
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>(B∨¬C)</span> and here is how it was built

<div  class="code_block indent display">
C
¬C
B∨¬C
A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>(B∨¬C)
</div>

This statement can be viewed as a theorem with premise <span class="code">A</span>
and conclusion <span class="code">B∨¬C</span> or simply as an “if <span class="code">A</span>
then <span class="code">B∨¬C</span>” statement.  I like to think of these
statements as propositions, but in fact all statements of the
Propositional Logic are said to be <span class="italicjz">propositions</span>.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Inference rules for the Propositional Logic tell us how to
determine whether a compound statement is true based on the truth
values of the statements from which it is built.  These rules
are explained through something called a <span class="italicjz">truth table</span>.
There are separate truth tables for ∧, ∨, and <span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The truth table for <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> is the table
requiring the most explanation.  Here it is

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="180px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/implies.png" alt="image: Truth table for "implies""/></div>

Let's look at how <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> could represent an actual
theorem, namely

<div  class="indent display">
If 2 divides <span class="code">n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span>, then 2 divides <span class="code">n</span>
</div>

Clearly
<div  class="indent display">
<span class="code">A</span> represents the premise, “2 divides <span class="code">n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span>”, and
<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
<span class="code">B</span> represents the conclusion, “2 divides <span class="code">n</span>”.
</div>

Not quite so clear, because it cannot be expressed in the
Propositional Logic, is that the theorem claims statement is true for
an arbitrary integer <span class="code">n</span>.  Keeping that fact in mind we can
interpret the truth table for this theorem.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The first two lines of the table tell us that the theorem
is true (i.e. <span class="italicjz">valid</span>), if for every <span class="code">n</span> with <span class="code">A</span> true, <span class="code">B</span> is also
true and false (i.e. <span class="italicjz">invalid</span>) if, for any <span class="code">n</span> with <span class="code">A</span> true, <span class="code">B</span> is
false.  The first line tells us what we have to establish to
show the theorem is valid   and the second
line tells us what we have to establish to show the theorem is
invalid.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The next two lines of the table tell us that if we misuse
a valid theorem with a false premise then the
conclusion is paradoxical, i.e. it can be both true and false.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Thinking this way, by which I mean in terms of <span class="code">A</span>'s
truth value, is not the only way to look at this table.  For
example, we can think in terms of <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>'s truth
value.  That means we are looking  the three lines in which
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> is true.  From that viewpoint we see that a
particular <span class="code">B</span> described in a valid theorem's conclusion
may be true but unprovable.  (At least not with the theorem in
question.) 
This is clearly seen in the third line which says a false
<span class="code">A</span> may be associated with a true <span class="code">B</span>. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> As an example consider the conclusion, “<span class="code">c</span> is a
country that borders the United States”, and the premise
“<span class="code">c</span> is the northernmost country in North America”.  You
can prove that <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> by looking at a map. There is
one country, Canada, that satisfies (i.e. makes true) the
premise and it borders the United States.  Mexico does not
satisfy the premise but does satisfy the conclusion.


<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
The other truth tables are easier to understand.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="160px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/2truthtables.png" alt="image: Truth tables for 'and', and 'or'"/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> For example if <span class="code">A</span> is true and <span class="code">B</span> is false then the table
on the left tells us that <span class="code">A∧B</span> is false.  Looking at
the table on the right and thinking in reverse,
suppose we know
that <span class="code">A∨B</span> is not true.  There is only one row in the
column for 
<span class="code">A∨B</span> that has an F.  The
values of <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> in that row are
both <span class="code">F</span>.  So the only way for <span class="code">A∨B</span> to be false is
for both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> be false.


<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
The Propositional Logic is an example of mathematics that is
sometimes used as metamathics.  Consider this table

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="190px" src="file:///Users/jazimmer/Dropbox/MathReader/images/notnot.png" alt="image: Implication and its contrapositive"/></div>

What this table does is to give us an inference rule that says to
prove <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>, you can prove the <span class="italicjz">contrapositive</span>
<span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> instead.  Since the contrapositive is
built up from <span class="code">¬B</span> and <span class="code">¬A</span>, columns for these
values are also
included in the table.   The truth values for
<span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> are determined by looking at the
columns for <span class="code">¬B</span> and <span class="code">¬A</span> and applying the
corresponding premise/conclusion pattern shown in the table defining
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>.  This pattern is included in this composite
table. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
For example to determine a truth value for 
<span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> when <span class="code">¬B</span> and <span class="code">¬A</span>
are both T (as seen in the first row of the table),
the same premise/consequence pattern for <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>
has to be looked up in the definition of <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>.
This is found in the last row of this composite
table and so the truth value for <span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> 
is T.
The important consequence is that when <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are
both T, the columns for
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> and <span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> show the same

Thus when <span class="code">A</span> is T and <span class="code">B</span> is F, the columns for
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> and <span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> show the same
truth value.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The same magic holds for rows three and four.  Thus
relationship between the truth
values for <span class="code">A</span>, <span class="code">B</span>, and <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> is the same
as the relationship between the truth values for <span class="code">A</span>,
<span class="code">B</span>, and <span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span>.  This means that proving the
contrapositive of <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> is also proves
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Proving <span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> as a proxy for
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> is
called <span class="italicjz">proving the contrapositive</span>.  Here is
an example of a theorem where proving the contrapositive is
valuable.

<div  class="indent display">
<span class="code">A = n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span> is even<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
<span class="code">B = n</span> is even<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
<span class="code">¬A =</span> n is odd<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
<span class="code">¬B = n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span> is odd
</div>

So the theorem (aka the proposition) says

<div  class="indent display">
For any <span class="code">n∊<span class="boldjz">Z</span></span>, if <span class="code">n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span> is even, so
is <span class="code">n</span>.  
</div>

A direct proof that <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> for any <span class="code">n∊<span class="boldjz">Z</span></span> isn't
difficult if you know the Prime Number Theorem.  If not, a
proof of the contrapositive,

<div  class="indent display">
if <span class="code">n</span> is odd, then so is <span class="code">n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span> ,
</div>

is the easiest way to go.  This is because it is easier
to draw conclusions about <span class="code">n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span> from characteristics
of <span class="code">n</span> than the other way around.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The trick to proving the contrapositive is to write <span class="code">2k</span> to mean any even number.
(This is just another way of saying that all even numbers are
multiples of 2.)  And to write <span class="code">2k+1</span> for any odd number.
(This is just another way of saying that any odd number is one
larger than some even number.)

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So the proof goes like this;

<div  class="indent display">
Let <span class="code">n</span> be odd, i.e. <span class="code">n=2k+1</span>, for some
<span class="code">k∊<span class="boldjz">Z</span></span>, then

<div  class="code_block indent display">
n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup> = (2k+1)(2k+1) 
          = 4k<sup class="smalljz">2</sup> + 4k + 1
          = 4(k<sup class="smalljz">2</sup>+k) + 1
</div>

Since the last expression has the form of an odd number we know
that <span class="code">n<sup class="smalljz">2</sup></span> is odd and the result is proved.
</div>

With the exception of proofs in formal logic, there is always a question
of how much detail to put into a mathematics proof.  Although
it is not uncommon in elementary books to repeat definitions
in proofs
and show how they apply, the proofs in this monograph often 
leave such details
out. That means if you find a proof confusing you should look
back at the relevant definitions, which are intended to be
simple and clear.
