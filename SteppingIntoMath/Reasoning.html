<h1 class="spaced1">Mathematical Reasoning</h1>

Although mathematicians are experimenting with other forms of
logic, mathematics itself is based on the belief that
statements must be true or false but <span class="code">not</span> both.  A
statement that is both true and false is a paradox.  Paradoxes and
mathematical reasoning do not get along with each other.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So around the beginning 
of the 20th century, mathematicians created rules that remove
the possibility of paradoxes getting into mathematics.  You
saw an important one of these rules in the first chapter: a set may not
directly or indirectly contain itself.  The principle extends
to more than sets.  A statement like this

<div  class="indent display">
“This sentence is false.”
</div>

is forbidden.  If you think about it, you will know it is
paradoxical, but it is forbidden because it references itself.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Continuing with the same kind of thinking, a mathematical
proof that a statement <span class="code">A</span> is true or false may not directly or
indirectly rely on the truth of <span class="code">A</span>.  However there is a
way it can <span class="italicjz">assume</span> the falsity of <span class="code">A</span>.

<h2 class="first">Proof by Contradiction</h2>

A proof by contradiction goes like this: To prove <span class="code">A</span> use the 
possibility that <span class="code">¬A</span> (aka not <span class="code">A</span>) is true as your starting point. 
If reasoning from that starting point leads to a paradox, then
something is wrong.  If your theory has no paradoxes and your
reasoning is correct, that something must be the assumption
that <span class="code">¬A</span> is true.  
Therefore <span class="code">A</span> must be true.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
By “leads to a paradox” is meant it is possible to prove
something is false that is known to be true or something is
true that is known to be false. In other words you are
contradicting something you already know.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div> A common example of a proof by contradiction is a proof
that there are infinitely many prime numbers. 

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
A prime number is a positive
integer that is divisible only by itself or 1.
</div>

How would you begin a proof by contradiction that there are
infinitely many primes<span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>answer</h4>
<div  class="indent display">
Assume that there are only
finitely many prime numbers.
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
If there are only finitely many prime numbers, we can list them in a
sequence like this 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
p<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>,p<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub>,p<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub>,…,p<sub class="sub_sup_size">n</sub>
</div>

Then let
<div  class="code_block indent display">
Xp = p<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>&times;p<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub>&times;p<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub>&times;…&times;p<sub class="sub_sup_size">n</sub>
</div>

Now consider <span class="code">Xp+1</span> which, like any integer greater than
one, is either prime or divisible by a prime.  Either
possibility
leads to a contradiction:

<ol><li>
If <span class="code">Xp+1</span> is prime then it is larger than all the
<span class="code">p<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> and its existence contradicts our
assumption that it is possible to list all the primes in a
finite sequence.
</li><li>
If <span class="code">Xp</span> is not prime then it is divisible by a prime
<span class="code">p</span>.  Our assumption says <span class="code">p</span> is one of the
<span class="code">p<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> and so <span class="code">p</span> also divides <span class="code">Xp</span>.
Because <span class="code">p</span> divides both <span class="code">Xp</span> and <span class="code">Xp+1</span> there are
numbers <span class="code">n</span> and <span class="code">m</span> such that <span class="code">n&times;p=Xp</span> and
<span class="code">m&times;p=Xp+1</span>.
<br/><br/>
Now <span class="code">Xp+1-Xp=1</span> and so substitituting for <span class="code">Xp</span> and
<span class="code">Xp+1</span>,

<div  class="code_block indent display">/
m&times;p - n&times;p = 1
</div>

or

<div  class="code_block indent display">
m - n = 1/p
</div>

which is impossible because <span class="code">m</span> and <span class="code">n</span>
are integers and <span class="code">1/p</span> is not (because <span class="code">p</span> is a prime
and primes are natural numbers greater than 1).
</li></ol>

Therefore our assumption leads to a contradiction and so the number of prime numbers cannot be finite.

<h2 class="next">Mathematical Induction</h2>

Here is a sequence of assertions

<div  class="code_block indent display">
A<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub>, A<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub>, A<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub>, …
</div>

There is not much information here, only that we have
infinitely many assertions each with its own natural number
subscript.  But if the <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> 
make the same claim about 
increasingly complicated data then mathematical induction may provide
a technique for proving the claim is true for all
<span><span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span></span>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Here is the proof process used by this technique.

<ol><li>
Prove <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span>.  <span class="italicjz">(the
base case)</span>
</li><li>
Prove an arbitrary <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span> (with
<span class="code">i&gt;1</span>), assuming it is known that the
<span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">j</sub></span><span class="smalljz">s</span> that came before are true.  <span class="italicjz">(the inductive step)</span>
</li></ol>

I think of this as a proving machine: once the base case
<span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> is
known to be true, the machine starts its work by proving
<span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span> knowing <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span>, then <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">3</sub></span>
knowing <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">1</sub></span> and <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">2</sub></span>, and so on.  Of course the machine never
finishes its job, but no matter what <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span> you are
interested in, the machine will get around to proving it in
finite time. 

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
What makes this different from simply picking an arbitrary
<span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span> (with <span class="code">i&gt;1</span>) and proving it is true, is that
 the proof of <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">i</sub></span> depends on knowing <span class="code">A<sub class="sub_sup_size">j</sub></span> is true for
 <span class="code">1≤j&lt;i</span>.
</div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
As an example let's prove that 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(n&times;(n+1))/2 = 1+2+3+…+n
</div>

for all <span class="code">n∊<span class="boldjz code">N</span></span>.

We start with the base case, which requires us to show that
<span class="code">(1&times;(1+1))/2</span> is equal to the a sum that adds up the
numbers in {<span class="code">1</span>}.  This is certainly true because the
formula evaluates to 1, and the sum is also 1.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
For the inductive step we need to prove that

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(i&times;(i+1))/2 = 1+2+3…+i
</div>

for any <span class="code">i&gt;1</span> under the assumption
   that 

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(j&times;(j+1))/2 = 1+2+3+…+j
</div>

for any natural number <span class="code">j</span> that is less than <span class="code">i</span>.
This bit of knowledge is called the <span class="italicjz">induction hypothesis</span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
For this proof what does the inducation hypothesis say about
<span class="code">i-1</span><span class="boldjz code">??</span>

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1+2+3+…+(i-1) = ((i-1)&times;(i-1+1)) / 2
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Using the induction hypothesis we get

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1+2+3+…+i = i + ((i-1)&times;(i-1+1)) / 2
          = 2&times;i/2 + ((i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (2&times;i+(i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = ((2+i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (i&times;(i+1))  / 2
</div>
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
I like to incorporate the concept of induction with a
technique that starts like a proof by
contradiction.  On this example this approach begins by
letting <span class="code">Nope</span> be the
set of all <span class="code">i</span> such that

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(i&times;(i+1))/2 ≠ 1+2+3…+i
</div>

The desired result is true exactly when <span class="code">Nope=∅</span>.
A proof by contradiction begins by assuming <span class="code">Nope</span> 
is not empty.  Under that assumption we can pick a smallest <span class="code">i∊Nope</span>.
If this leads to a contradiction, we know <span class="code">Nope</span> is empty.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Sometimes a proof by contradiction has to be broken into cases
and it is necessary to prove each case leads to a
contradiction.  That is the situation here.  
We need to consider two cases:
<span class="code">i=1</span> or <span class="code">i&gt;1</span>.  Notice that this is the same division
into cases we needed with a standard induction.  The base case
considered <span class="code">i=1</span> and the induction step proved the claim
for <span class="code">i&gt;1</span>.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
So the proof goes like this.
<div  class="indent display"><ol><li>
This <span class="code">i</span> cannot be 1 because

<div  class="code_block indent display">
(1&times;(1+1))/2 = 1 
</div>
</li><li>

This <span class="code">i</span> cannot be greater than 1 because if it is then
<span class="code">i-1<span style='font-size:70%'>∉</span>Nope</span> and so

<div  class="code_block indent display">
( (i-1)&times;i) ) = 1+2+3+…+(i-1)
</div>

This means

<div  class="code_block indent display">
1+2+3+…+i = i + ((i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = 2&times;i/2 + ((i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (2&times;i+(i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = ((2+i-1)&times;i) / 2
          = (i&times;(i+1))  / 2
</div>

showing <span class="code">i</span> cannot be greater than 1.
</li><li>
From 1. and 2. we see that <span class="code">Nope</span> cannot contain a least integer which of
course means <span class="code">Nope=</span>∅ and so
the result is true.
</li></ol>
</div>

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Mathematical induction apparently first appeared in the 19th
century.  Of course there were other techniques before that.
Here is a picture proof of the formula for adding the first
<span class="code">n</span> numbers that appeared in ancient times 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="150px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/SteppingIntoMath/images/SumWithout.png" alt="image: Summation Image Without any Variables"/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Variables were introduced in Europe at the end of the 17th
century. Here is the same proof with some annotating
variables.
</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="180px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/SteppingIntoMath/images/SumWith.png" alt="image: Summation Image With Variable N"/></div>

Now you can see the area of the rectangle is <span class="code">n&times;(n+1)</span>
and the shaded part is both half the total area and 
the result of adding <span class="code">1+2+3+…+n</span>.

<h2 class="next">Propositional Logic</h2>

Metamathematics is the use of mathematics to investigate
mathematics.  Exactly which parts of mathematics you can use
in metamathematics depends on which aspect of
mathematics you are studying. 

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The Propositional Logic is a bit of mathematics that also
qualifies as metamathematics.  We can use it to make new
inference rules for mathematics.  The language of the
Propositional Logic consists 
of atomic statements and compound statements.
All statements can be referenced with variable names
that begin with a capital letter and represent an assertion
that something is true or false.

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display">
Although not done here, it is the statements of Propositional
Logic are often referred to as propositions.  
</div>

Atomic statements may be created by fiat, i.e.

<div  class="indent display">
let <span class="code">R</span> be the statement, “It will rain today.”
<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
let <span class="code">S</span> be the statement, “Every natural number
is prime.”
</div>

When atomic statements are created  they are given a value of
true (T) or false (F).  This value does not come from the
Propositional Logic, it is given to the Propositional Logic
having been determined in some other way.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Compound statements are built up from other statements
(from both atomic statements and
compound statements).  One way to do this
is to negate a statement.  So if <span class="code">A</span> is T then ¬<span class="code">A</span>
(aka not <span class="code">A</span>)
is F and if <span class="code">A</span> is F then ¬<span class="code">A</span> is T.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Compound statements can also be built using one of the following three constructions:

<ul><li>
<span class="smalljz">Build <span class="code">A∧B</span> from <span class="code">A</span>
and <span class="code">B</span> -- <span class="italicjz">think “and”</span></span>
</li><li>
<span class="smalljz">Build <span class="code">A∨B</span> from <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> -- <span class="italicjz">think “or”.</span> </span>
</li><li>
<span class="smalljz">Build <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> from <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> -- <span class="italicjz">think “implies”.</span> </span>
</li></ul>

Here is a compound statement:
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>(B∨¬C)</span> and here is how it was built

<div  class="code_block indent display">
C
¬C
B∨¬C
A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>(B∨¬C)
</div>

This statement can be viewed as a theorem with premise <span class="code">A</span>
and conclusion <span class="code">B∨¬C</span> or simply as an “if <span class="code">A</span>
then <span class="code">B∨¬C</span>” statement with the same premise and
conclusion.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
An <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> statement can also be used to interpret a
theorem.  Consider this

<div  class="indent display">
If 2 divides <span class="code">n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span>, then 2 divides <span class="code">n</span>
</div>

Clearly
<ul><li>
the premise, “2 divides <span class="code">n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span>”, is represented with <span class="code">A</span>, and
</li><li>
the conclusion, “2 divides <span class="code">n</span>”, is represented with <span class="code">B</span>.
</li></ul>

Not quite so clear, because it cannot be expressed in the
Propositional Logic, is that the theorem claims statement is true for
an arbitrary integer <span class="code">n</span>.  In this case
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> represents a set of <span><span class="code">A</span><span class="smalljz">s</span></span> and
related 
<span><span class="code">B</span><span class="smalljz">s</span></span>, one <span class="code">(A,B)</span> pair for each <span class="code">n∊<span class="boldjz">Z</span></span>.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The Propositional Logic tells us how the truth
values of these <span><span class="code">A</span><span class="smalljz">s</span></span> and <span><span class="code">B</span><span class="smalljz">s</span></span> must be related
to each other.  That relationship is expressed in a <span class="italicjz">truth
table</span>. There is a truth table for each of the three kinds of
compound statements.  Here is the truth table for
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="180px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/SteppingIntoMath/images/implies.png" alt="image: Truth table for "implies""/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The first two lines of the table tell us that the above theorem
is true (i.e. <span class="italicjz">valid</span>), if for every <span class="code">n</span> with <span class="code">A</span> true, <span class="code">B</span> is also
true and false (i.e. <span class="italicjz">invalid</span>) if, for any <span class="code">n</span> with <span class="code">A</span> true, <span class="code">B</span> is
false.  The first line tells us what we have to establish to
show the theorem is valid   and the second
line tells us what we have to establish to show the theorem is
invalid.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> The next two lines of the table tell us that if we misuse
a valid theorem with a false premise, for example “7
divides <span>3<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span>”, then the
conclusion is paradoxical, i.e. it can be both true and false.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> Taken by itself the third line of this truth table seems
incorrect, how can a true thing be concluded from a false
thing?.  It cannot, but there may be an <span class="code">(A,B)</span> pair in
which <span class="code">A</span> is F and <span class="code">B</span> is T.  Consider this theorem

<div  class="indent display">
If a country is northenmost on the North American continent,
then that country borders the United States.
</div>

This theorem can be applied to any country but the only
country which makes the premise true is Canada.  When
<span><span class="code">A</span> is “Mexico is northenmost on the North American
continent”</span> and <span class="code">B</span> is “Mexico borders the
United States”, <span class="code">A</span> is F and <span class="code">B</span> is T.  The theorem
isn't invalid.  Rather the theorem is not inclusive enough to
recognize all the countries which border the United States.

<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
The other truth tables are easier to understand.

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="160px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/SteppingIntoMath/images/2truthtables.png" alt="image: Truth tables for 'and', and 'or'"/></div>

</div><div  class="undefined half_display"> For example if <span class="code">A</span> is true and <span class="code">B</span> is false then the table
on the left tells us that <span class="code">A∧B</span> is false.  Looking at
the table on the right and thinking in reverse,
suppose we know
that <span class="code">A∨B</span> is not true.  There is only one row in the
column for 
<span class="code">A∨B</span> that has an F.  The
values of <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> in that row are
both <span class="code">F</span>.  So the only way for <span class="code">A∨B</span> to be false is
for both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> be false.


<h2 class="next">Using the Propositional Logic</h2>
As mentioned in the previous section
the Propositional Logic is an example of mathematics that is
sometimes used as metamathematics.  In this section we look at an
example of this.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Consider this table

<div  class="center display"><img class="center" height="190px" src="http://www.jazimmer.net/SteppingIntoMath/images/notnot.png" alt="image: Implication and its contrapositive"/></div>

The statement <span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> is called the
<span class="italicjz">contrapositive</span> of <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>.  Since the contrapositive is
built up from <span class="code">¬B</span> and <span class="code">¬A</span>, columns for these
values are also
included in the table.   The truth values for
<span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> are determined by looking at the
columns for <span class="code">¬B</span> and <span class="code">¬A</span> and applying the
corresponding premise/conclusion pattern shown in the table defining
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>.  This pattern is included in this composite
table.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
Because the columns for <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> and its contrapositive
are the same, we know that any <span class="code">(A,B)</span> pair that satisfies
<span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> will satisfy <span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> and
vice versa.  That tells us that to
prove <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span>, you can prove the <span class="italicjz">contrapositive</span>
<span class="code">¬B<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>¬A</span> instead.  

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So <span class="italicjz">proving the contrapositive</span> is an inference rule
that is derived from a metamathematical use of the
Propositional Logic.  



<div class="spaced1">&nbsp;</div>
Here is an example of a theorem for which proving the contrapositive is
valuable.

<div  class="indent display">
<span class="code">A = n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span> is even<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
<span class="code">B = n</span> is even<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
<span class="code">¬A =</span> n is odd<div class="ln">&nbsp</div>
<span class="code">¬B = n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span> is odd
</div>

So the theorem says

<div  class="indent display">
For any <span class="code">n∊<span class="boldjz">Z</span></span>, if <span class="code">n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span> is even, so
is <span class="code">n</span>.  
</div>

A direct proof that <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> for any <span class="code">n∊<span class="boldjz">Z</span></span> isn't
difficult if you know the Prime Number Theorem.  If not, a
proof of the contrapositive is easier.  So, instead of
proving the theorem, we will prove

<div  class="indent display">
if <span class="code">n</span> is odd, then so is <span class="code">n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span> ,
</div>

What makes this easier is that
to draw conclusions about <span class="code">n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span> from characteristics
of <span class="code">n</span> is easier than the other way around.

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
The trick to proving this contrapositive involves noticing
that <span class="code">2k+1</span> can represent any odd number as <span class="code">k</span> varies
over all integers.
(This is just another way of saying that any odd number is one
larger than some even number.)

</div><div  class="undefined half_display">
So the proof goes like this;

<div  class="indent display">
Let <span class="code">n</span> be odd, i.e. <span class="code">n=2k+1</span>, for some
<span class="code">k∊<span class="boldjz">Z</span></span>, then

<div  class="code_block indent display">
n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup> = (2k+1)(2k+1) 
          = 4k<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup> + 4k + 1
          = 4(k<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup>+k) + 1
</div>

Since the last expression has the form of an odd number we know
that <span class="code">n<sup class="sub_sup_size">2</sup></span> is odd and the result is proved.
</div>

<div  class="indent smalljz italicjz display"> With the exception of proofs in formal logic, there is
always a question of how much detail to put into a mathematics
proof. The general rule seems to be to give as much detail as
the reader needs.  That of course depends on the reader.
<br/><br/>
Some elementary texts give lots of detail.  Here I assume a reader who does not need to see
definitions repeated again and again and who does not need to be
told that to prove <span class="code">A<span style="font-size:115%">⇒</span>B</span> you normally start with
<span class="code">A</span> and then reason your way to <span class="code">B</span>.
